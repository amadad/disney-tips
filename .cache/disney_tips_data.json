the theme park ticket","timestamp":"18:21"},{"text":"calendar is going to show me the entire","timestamp":"18:23"},{"text":"range of Disney World ticket prices for","timestamp":"18:25"},{"text":"the

is","timestamp":"19:08"},{"text":"$139 per night no discounts applied I","timestamp":"19:10"},{"text":"looked at two other All-Star options","timestamp":"19:13"},{"text":"just in case they were any different and","timestamp":"19:15"},{"text":"it seems All-Star Music also costs $1","timestamp":"19:17"},{"text":"139 for a standard room around that same","timestamp":"19:19"},{"text":"time but

me","timestamp":"19:25"},{"text":"closer to the resort sp&amp;#39;s main amenities","timestamp":"19:27"},{"text":"like the lobby and feature pool the","timestamp":"19:29"},{"text":"preferred room cost

don&amp;#39;t Sparkle what get out of","timestamp":"16:45"},{"text":"here so the question you might be asking","timestamp":"16:48"},{"text":"us right now is did we like breakfast or","timestamp":"16:50"},{"text":"dinner more at the cake Bak shop the","timestamp":"16:53"},{"text":"cheap answer would be it depends on what","timestamp":"16:55"},{"text":"you prefer but my more in-depth answer","timestamp":"16:56"},{"text":"is is there is something enchanting","timestamp":"16:58"},{"text":"about coming to this restaurant at night","timestamp":"17:00"},{"text":"especially when you want a mean kavat","timestamp":"17:02"},{"text":"tapi however breakfasts and Disney world","timestamp":"17:04"},{"text":"that are unique and go beyond the eggs","timestamp":"17:06"},{"text":"and bacon offerings can be few and far","timestamp":"17:08"},{"text":"between so we really appreciated the","timestamp":"17:10"},{"text":"nice mix of familiar morning options at","timestamp":"17:12"},{"text":"cake bake shop along the more unique and","timestamp":"17:14"},{"text":"decadent options too that being said","timestamp":"17:17"},{"text":"you&amp;#39;re still paying a pretty penny for","timestamp":"17:19"},{"text":"breakfast here like that amazing kavat","timestamp":"17:21"},{"text":"tapi for dinner is 24 bucks and the","timestamp":"17:23"},{"text":"broccoli kiche is the same price which","timestamp":"17:25"},{"text":"seems a bit wild to me many times when","timestamp":"17:27"},{"text":"you choose to dine at a Disney World","timestamp":"17:29"},{"text":"restaurant for breakfast you&amp;#39;re doing so","timestamp":"17:30"},{"text":"cuz you want to experience the","timestamp":"17:32"},{"text":"restaurant&amp;#39;s atmosphere for a more","timestamp":"17:33"},{"text":"affordable price point that&amp;#39;s not always","timestamp":"17:35"},{"text":"the case but it is the case in many","timestamp":"17:37"},{"text":"situations like the ever so popular","timestamp":"17:39"},{"text":"Cinderella&amp;#39;s Royal table in Magic","timestamp":"17:40"},{"text":"Kingdom for instance but when it comes","timestamp":"17:42"},{"text":"to Cake Bake Shop you could easily pay","timestamp":"17:45"},{"text":"around the same price for breakfast here","timestamp":"17:47"},{"text":"that you would for a nice dinner and you","timestamp":"17:49"},{"text":"might be okay with that but if you&amp;#39;d","timestamp":"17:51"},{"text":"rather save your dinner Splurge for a","timestamp":"17:52"},{"text":"nice date night with more options Beyond","timestamp":"17:54"},{"text":"just the breakfast spreads then you may","timestamp":"17:56"},{"text":"prefer an evening meal to cake bake shop","timestamp":"17:57"},{"text":"versus a morning one okay I don&amp;#39;t want","timestamp":"17:59"},{"text":"to ignore those prices that we just","timestamp":"18:01"},{"text":"listed off because I know they are","timestamp":"18:03"},{"text":"shocking believe it or not they actually","timestamp":"18:05"},{"text":"used to be even more shocking before the","timestamp":"18:07"},{"text":"restaurant opened its doors when the","timestamp":"18:09"},{"text":"cake bake shop debuted its menu before","timestamp":"18:11"},{"text":"it opened up shop it was met with a lot","timestamp":"18:13"},{"text":"of backlash cuz the prices felt very","timestamp":"18:15"},{"text":"high for items you can normally get","timestamp":"18:17"},{"text":"around Disney for a whole lot less but","timestamp":"18:19"},{"text":"the cake bake shop did see online","timestamp":"18:21"},{"text":"perplexit from people following their","timestamp":"18:23"},{"text":"menu release which led them to unveil a","timestamp":"18:25"},{"text":"new menu just a few days later with","timestamp":"18:27"},{"text":"updated prices for lots of the items the","timestamp":"18:29"},{"text":"broccoli kiche now is at $23.99 it was","timestamp":"18:32"},{"text":"previously 28 a classic burger with palm","timestamp":"18:35"},{"text":"freets cost $26.99 it was previously 32","timestamp":"18:38"},{"text":"children&amp;#39;s Buttered Noodles can

of $122 and that&amp;#39;s","timestamp":"18:48"},{"text":"only a portion of the prices that","timestamp":"18:51"},{"text":"dropped before opening day not every","timestamp":"18:52"},{"text":"price tag dropped but quite a few did","timestamp":"18:55"},{"text":"except for a few of the options which","timestamp":"18:57"},{"text":"actually went up in price a cafe latte","timestamp":"18:59"},{"text":"now cost $7.99 but it cost $6 before and","timestamp":"19:01"},{"text":"a chai tea latte now cost $8.99 compared","timestamp":"19:05"},{"text":"to $7 before regardless of the price","timestamp":"19:07"},{"text":"drops this restaurant is still going to","timestamp":"19:10"},{"text":"be a Splurge to eat at particularly for","timestamp":"19:11"},{"text":"the

it&amp;#39;s","timestamp":"19:17"},{"text":"not as big of a Splurge as some","timestamp":"19:19"},{"text":"restaurants on property especially since","timestamp":"19:21"},{"text":"it doesn&amp;#39;t have a prefix menu so you can","timestamp":"19:23"},{"text":"order whatever you want without being","timestamp":"19:25"},{"text":"forced to pay for an appetizer

that","timestamp":"19:42"},{"text":"happened so I feel like the prices at","timestamp":"19:45"},{"text":"cake bake shop are starting to","timestamp":"19:48"},{"text":"approximate what you&amp;#39;re going to get","timestamp":"19:50"},{"text":"outside the Disney bubble too which is","timestamp":"19:51"},{"text":"crazy but you know I&amp;#39;m not defending any","timestamp":"19:53"},{"text":"of this I&amp;#39;m just giving context so I","timestamp":"19:55"},{"text":"think you got to decide how you want to","timestamp":"19:58"},{"text":"approach the cake bake shop if you want","timestamp":"20:00"},{"text":"to eat here you could totally just go in","timestamp":"20:02"},{"text":"there and get waters and one entree each","timestamp":"20:04"},{"text":"to keep the total cost relatively","timestamp":"20:06"},{"text":"affordable in Disney standards at least","timestamp":"20:07"},{"text":"or you could go in ready to enjoy those","timestamp":"20:10"},{"text":"signature

happened at Disney this week the","timestamp":"0:45"},{"text":"first day of Premiere pass in Disney","timestamp":"0:48"},{"text":"World yes it is here and there&amp;#39;s an","timestamp":"0:50"},{"text":"issue okay that may be dramatic but","timestamp":"0:53"},{"text":"stick with me earlier this fall Disney","timestamp":"0:55"},{"text":"announced the new lightning Lane","timestamp":"0:57"},{"text":"Premiere pass option the system which","timestamp":"0:59"},{"text":"was first used at Disneyland earlier in","timestamp":"1:01"},{"text":"October before debuting at Walt Disney","timestamp":"1:03"},{"text":"World on the 30th allows onetime entry","timestamp":"1:05"},{"text":"to each lightning Lane experience in a","timestamp":"1:07"},{"text":"theme park so you buy it for one Park","timestamp":"1:10"},{"text":"you can go on all the lightning Lane","timestamp":"1:12"},{"text":"rides whenever you want just one time","timestamp":"1:13"},{"text":"now the big kicker is that Premier pass","timestamp":"1:16"},{"text":"costs between $130 and $400 per person","timestamp":"1:18"},{"text":"per Park per day and it is only","timestamp":"1:22"},{"text":"available to those staying at Deluxe","timestamp":"1:24"},{"text":"Disney Resorts or select other Resorts","timestamp":"1:26"},{"text":"the pricing will change each day the","timestamp":"1:29"},{"text":"same

all four","timestamp":"2:06"},{"text":"of Disney World&amp;#39;s theme parks on its","timestamp":"2:08"},{"text":"debut day and found that the on the","timestamp":"2:10"},{"text":"ground experience wasn&amp;#39;t all that","timestamp":"2:12"},{"text":"different from using lightning Lane","timestamp":"2:13"},{"text":"multipass and lightning Lane single pass","timestamp":"2:15"},{"text":"specifically once you scan your phone at","timestamp":"2:17"},{"text":"a given attractions entrance you join","timestamp":"2:19"},{"text":"the same line that&amp;#39;s being used by multi","timestamp":"2:21"},{"text":"and single pass purchasers while these","timestamp":"2:23"},{"text":"weights are usually pretty short it&amp;#39;s","timestamp":"2:25"},{"text":"still the same exact experience and","timestamp":"2:27"},{"text":"weight so the primary extra benefits for","timestamp":"2:29"},{"text":"using the premier pass are the ability","timestamp":"2:31"},{"text":"to ride every eligible attraction","timestamp":"2:33"},{"text":"whenever you want as opposed to needing","timestamp":"2:35"},{"text":"to schedule a specific time and while","timestamp":"2:37"},{"text":"those are definitely benefits it&amp;#39;s","timestamp":"2:40"},{"text":"arguable as to whether they&amp;#39;re enough to","timestamp":"2:41"},{"text":"justify the large price jump from the","timestamp":"2:43"},{"text":"multi-pass and single pass lightning","timestamp":"2:46"},{"text":"Lane to the premier pass we are
