I like that. Cozy. It's cute. And it's going fast. All right, after a quick shopping trip inside of the Emporium, we're headed back to the plaza. Decided to join the wait list while we looked around and our table has called. It is ready. So, we are on our way to claim our table. I'm so excited. We've not eaten here in a bit. And the menu looks really good. They have like some holiday sammies. Yeah, they do. And my mouth is watering. Okay. Thank you. Yes. Nice. We've been once or a couple times before actually. Thank you. I like it. Oh, this is a great one. Thank you. That is the best. They have their special holiday offerings. The pot roast looks so good. And then they also have a turkey meatloaf, which also sounds really good. So, we may get one of each to share. Cornbreed. I know. Let's see. Do you want macaroni and cheese? Yes, please. Wash your hands, please. Wipe your hands, please. had many variations over the years, but we are still doing the coloring mats. We decided to do big strokes today. We have some straws. These are actually compostable straws. So, fun fact there. And then we also have some little cup lids, these seal things down colors, and then the wet wipes for sanitizing. It looks so good though. That looks Oh my gosh. Fancy. Fancy. So fancy. And I also have mashed potatoes. Thank you. Mac and cheese. Couple of fries. Apple slices. Same thing. Is it? Yeah, that's a different one. She says it's like a cranberry sauce. Oh, interesting. Okay. The pot roast is really good. It's super tender. That is the aioli, which is a type of I think isn't it? A mayo base. Aioli mayo. It's really good. It's really good except for when you take a bite of it and you're thinking it's gravy. Not gravy. gravy. That is good, isn't it? I like it. The struggle bus is real. If I had glasses on right now, I think you're flying. That's good. Heat. Heat. Let's go ride the Na'vi ride. Yeah, we're going to ride the Na'vi ride and we're going to ride Flight of Passage for Lucy. Sorry, Taipei. Okay, I'm like rule follower. Our first time going on to you got that. Hello. It's okay. I made it. Watch out. Loose. We made it. We've made it back to the resort cuz it is time for mom and dad's nap. They're like, \"We don't want a nap. We don't need a nap. We have energy. I I would like to relax. It's a rift. We've taken some steps today.\" Yes. 5:30 this morning was a while back. It is now 2:30. Only 11,000 steps only. I'm just ready for a nice little chill. Lunch was nice and I kind of felt recharged after that, but I don't know. There's just nothing like coming back and relaxing in the room. Just for a few minutes. Doesn't have to be long. Just a few minutes of chill. It's very nice. So, we're going to do that, get changed, and then the plan is to head off to Animal Kingdom. We've got some Lightning Lane stacked for later. got a single pass for Flight of Passage. So, we are ready to go fit in some Animal Kingdom Christmas. So, we're excited. There's our house. That's the bike. This is the reality of a midday break. Sometimes I set an alarm for an hour and a half, 2 hours later and it goes off and we're all like waking the dead. And then other times it's like 20 minutes later and I am wide awake and now wired. I'm going to go grab a bottle of water cuz Lord knows I need to hydrate. Um and then yeah, we're going to see. It is 4:25. We've got just a little bit left on the timer. We have a shorter break today. So, we could only rest for about an hour 15 minutes. So, we have about 15 minutes left of that hour 15 minutes. So, we'll see. Dean was still resting pretty good. And the girls are like gone. Even though literally out of their mouth, they were saying, \"I don't need a nap. I don't want a break. I have so much energy.\" As we're walking back. Also, no, my kids don't nap at home. They're four and six years old. If your kids are that age and still napping, congratulations. You really should deserve a prize, but mine do not. I mean, we don't nap at home on the daily, but when it comes to Disney, we nap because we like early in we like staying up and closing out a park and enjoying fireworks and those types of things. Um, so yeah, that's that is how it works for us. Um, if we didn't do those breaks, it it wouldn't be pretty because we're going to be tired and we're going to be upset and we're going to be emotional and it's going to be hard a lot harder to regulate all that if you're not taking a little bit of a break. Um, I'm excited. We're doing Animal Kingdom. I am a little disappointed about today cuz they've changed the hours for the safari. So, I was really hoping for like an evening sunset safari, but they've shortened the hours to where it now closes at like 4:45, even if the park is open until 8:00 p.m. Um, when I picked our park days, that was not the case. And then now today, I go back and double check cuz I'm like, why am I not getting lightning lanes for later? That's why. Oh well, we'll have fun. we get to see the Zootopia show and then we are going to do like all the Avatar stuff that we like. So, I don't know. Like I like Animal Kingdom, but with so much of it down, I'm just kind of like we can do a little less time there. Um, I really like it in Animal Kingdom. It is fun, but I need him to like open some stuff up cuz it's getting slimmer pickings. Let's go this way. I want to try something. You heard it here first, folks. I want to try something. Oh, I see what you're going to try. You're going to try going across and through and the back so it's faster. Yeah, that's the idea. And that's how we find stuff out. Oh, look. It's Goofy in the ticket booth. inside of the ticket booth. Look, see behind the curtain. Oh, look at that. Got the tree up. They are decked and ready for Christmas. I love it. Look, everybody say cheese. One, two, three, cheese. All right. And cheese. One more time. All right. Silly face. All right. And a four real happy face really quick. Not right now. So pretty. Look at that. We can't see Pandora. All right, Lucy. Right over there, babe. Have a good night. Thank you. How beautiful it is out here. Dad, Dad, let's try let's try shooting out water. Daddy, let's not do it now. Doing it. doing it. I don't think it's going to change. I think it's too late. It's sleepy. A There it goes. We did it. We did it. Look at that. I got I got beef chim chim chim chim chim ch. We got you the same thing. I did. I just got mine without the slo and the bulbasa. Nice. And then we got one of the the cheeseburger buns. And then she got the hot dog. That looks good. That's okay. Kind of orange. Thank you. That's delicious. All right, we'll catch up with you in a minute. I like it. Oh, careful. Yum. Got a whole bubble party going over here. Waiting on Daddy and while they're doing rider switch. They're going on a Flight of Passage with our special Lightning Lane. Okay, the wait is 70 minutes right now. And this bubble wand is the winner. Forever picking the bubble wand over the balloon. I love the balloons. They are so fun. But these last even longer. Whoa. Double bubble wand. Look out. Let's do this. and linked to an avatar. Using avatars to fly this way was all figured out by my boss, Dr. Jackie Octton. There's your seat. All right, travelers. Once you're all seated, please be sure to sit up nice and tall. Lean all the way forward. Here we go. Whoa. What just happened? No way. Wow. So peaceful. Oh, we're not anymore. Uh, are we going to go in for the new docu in just a minute? There we go. Look at all this water around it, baby girl. We are going into the tree for Zootopia. I never went to the inside. I don't know. You did, but the last time we did was a few years ago when you didn't like it. So, it was tough to be a bug. It was tough to be a bug. And it was tough to be little kids with. It's tough to be a bug. We're going under the tree now. We're going under the tree, right? We are together. Happy together day. Please no flash or video lighting during the watch time. Tell your turtle friends thank they me I happy zoo together. Now your job press that big red button totally standard. Okay. I'll check the time while you interview the witnesses. I can help you. Really? The man. No. It's glow stick. Carter a star. Blue. What did everybody think of Zootopia? You got to do a quick review. Did you like it? Uhhuh. I liked it. I thought it was cute. Tell me what part you love. I like the part where they were talking and it was spraying water all over the the audience. I say what it was what they like blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. My favorite part was the end. The end where all the singing and dancing. Yeah. Yeah, that was pretty good. My favorite part, Bella. That would be the blah blah blah blah blah. What was your favorite part? Oh, I liked the seals when they were dressed like Ariel. That was funny. It's fun. Did you like when the little mice ran under our bones? I thought that was funny. Did really? Yeah. You didn't feel it? I did. Do you feel it? I did. I felt bump back and forth. That was crazy. Mom, I liked it. That part. It was silly. It was silly. Mom, uh, I think it blah blah blah blah. Yeah. Mom. Um, I think the chairs to it felt like mouses were going under a bunch. Yeah, I think so, too. All right. What was your favorite part, Daddy? I definitely thought the seals dressed up as mermaids were hilarious. That was I like that part. There was so much going on. It was almost hard to catch it all. She's like, she Yeah, that was a good one. All right, that was fun. Other than it's tough to be a bug. Yes, definitely. But it is 8:12. The park officially closed at 8:00. They did one last awakening. Um, which on in the app it said it wasn't supposed to start until November 14th and today was the 7th. So, I mean, I'm not mad that it started early cuz we love watching the tree awaken. Um, that was cool. But that was really pretty. And each one is different. And I think it's every 10 or 15 minutes they do it. Oh, really? But the two different ones that we saw tonight, they're slightly different each time with different animals and stuff. So, if you get a chance, definitely check it out. It's also beautiful from the back side of the tree as well. So, if you get to watch it from back there, a lot less people. It's really pretty. But, I think we are going to head out. Tomorrow is our Jollywood day or Jollywood night. So, we're going to take it easy tomorrow morning and we're going to go have a lot of fun. But if you enjoyed today's vlog and coming along for the day, then go ahead, click that thumbs up button, red subscribe button. If you're new, would absolutely love to have you in the internet fam and end of the video club, you've got to let us know. Are you more of a park hopping family doing multiple things or are you a one park per day? Typically, that is us, but we took advantage of Magic Kingdom being a party day this morning, and we're like, we really want to do some evening Animal Kingdom time, so we're squeezing it in. So, that is that for our day, but I would love to hear about you guys down in the comment section, but I will see you here in the next one. Bye. a beautiful thing just happened. We were like, \"Oo, they still got pastries over there.\" Went up to check and Ash said, \"Got any pink donuts?\" And they said, \"Hey, just so you know, it holdries if I want to get one right now.\" So, I got a cronut. She got a pink donut. Bella's got a pink donut. And Lucy's got a chocolate donut. What a beautiful day. Beautiful cap to the beautiful day. Ready? Hi.

      "transcript": "Magic Kingdom is taking some unexpected twists and turns next year, but in today's ultimate guide, we're going to make sure you're prepared for a 2026 visit to this ultra popular park, no matter what changes are thrown your way. Hey everybody, it's AJ for Disney Food Blog. Welcome to Magic Kingdom, a place of castle dining, barberh shop quartets, and construction walls apparently. But I'm getting ahead of myself here. We're going to talk about what's going down in the kingdom this year so that you're either a ready for that 2026 vacation that you've been dreaming up for the longest time or b at the very least well informed and ready to hear all the piping hot tea. Guess we should get this can of worms out of the way first. Magic Kingdom is going to look real different this year in good ways and in kind of awkward ways. So, let me tell you about the key pros and cons for a Magic Kingdom 2026 visit right now to help you better prepare for the future. The cons, lots of construction, like lots. The thick of the construction is coming from the back side of the park, which is already kind of a blemish for Magic Kingdom at the moment. Tom Sawyer Island and Liberty Square Riverboat permanently closed on July 7th, 2025 to accommodate the construction of Piston Peak National Park based on the movie Cars and the future Disney Villains Land. Both are going to be awesome new additions in the future, providing more rides, more attractions, more shopping and dining and all around more memory making. But the problem is we don't know when these new lands are going to be opening up shop. And our best guess is years down the road. That means Magic Kingdom is going to have fewer things to offer here for a little bit. Doesn't mean you're going to get bored in the slightest. There's still plenty to see and do. It's just good to set expectations and know that this back half of Magic Kingdom is going to be way less immersive for a while, and there are fewer Btier attractions, which can mean more crowding in other places around Liberty Square and Frontier Land for the time being. The next point's a bit of a half and half. Half pro, halfcon, depending on when you visit. Attractions like Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger Spin will also be closed at the start of next year, but they've already been closed for a good long while throughout 2025. While we don't know when they're slated to reopen, we do know that Disney plans to reopen them sometime in 2026. And that's great if your vacation just so happens to align with those reopening plans. But for the release of this video, there are no exact dates for us to go off of yet. So, you might want to wait before you lock in your 2026 vacation dates, just until we hear about something more concrete for those refreshed rides. Or you can just lock in your trip anyways and cross your fingers without getting your hopes too high up. Another thing to be on your toes about are potential closures for Carousel of Progress since Disney recently announced they'd be adding a new scene at the start of the show sometime in the future featuring a Walt Disney animatronic like you can find over at Disneyland now. And a big one to be on the lookout for. Cinderella Castle will be getting a paint job in the future, switching her back to her OG blue and white colors. Lots of Disney fans are thrilled to hear about that one. But whenever it does happen, expect some serious scrims and construction to pop up around the castle there. No matter when your Magic Kingdom visit is slated to happen, there are new things that started up in Magic Kingdom in 2025 that you can check out for the first time ever next year if you haven't already gotten the chance to see them. The two key new things, Disney Starlight Dream the Night Away parade is dazzling the Magic Kingdom streets each night, featuring bright and glowing floats with new and classic Disney characters alike. The parade tends to happen twice nightly, once before and once after Happily Ever After. But it's best to check your My Disney Experience app and find out the exact times that the show will commence on the evening of your visit. And Beacon Barrel is the new Pirates of the Caribbean themed interactive lounge over in Adventure Land with tropical drinks and interesting bites and lots of immersive moments that help expand the Pirates of the Caribbean storyline. This lounge is small but mighty popular, so you'll need to prioritize those advanced dining reservations 60 days before your visit if it's a priority spot for you. Magic Kingdom on a normal day is a great time, but during a Magic Kingdom special event, you could really plus up your visit with limited time entertainment and potentially shorter ride lines. We got a full Disney World 12 month calendar already fixed up and ready to send your way. All you need to do is scan the QR code you see on the screen or click on the link in the description for Disneyfoodblog.com/wdwcal right after this. But for now, we're going to stick with the Magic Kingdom stuff since, you know, MK's the star of our show today. After hours events are returning to Magic Kingdom on select nights from January 12th to July 27th, 2026. I'm becoming a real big fan of these events. Well, I shouldn't even say becoming. I've been a huge fan of these events for a long time. Prices for them can be as expensive, if not more expensive, than a regular day ticket. But capacity for after hours is limited, meaning you'll have access to over 20 Magic Kingdom attractions, including the super popular ones like Tron and Seven Dwarfs Mine Train without all the extra waiting around and Lightning Lane planning. And guess what? Ice cream, popcorn, and drinks are included with admission, too. So, anytime you're starting to feel hungry, grab a snack and don't think twice. Magic Kingdom's After Hours are ultra special because they also come with an exclusive fireworks show, Disney Enchantment. And that's doubly awesome because that means you'll get double the fireworks action with your after hours ticket. Disney After Hours at Magic Kingdom begins at 10:00 p.m. and lasts for 3 hours, ending at 1:00 a.m. And guests with event tickets are allowed to enter the park as early as 7, meaning you'll still be able to watch the general admission Happily Ever After Fireworks show as well. You can also meet Mickey Mouse at Town Square Theater and meet Disney princesses at Princess Fairy Tale Hall during after hours if you'd like to prioritize some of those popular characters, too. So, lots to do during this event, but way fewer people to get in your way. Super super win. Also, if you're there in the summer, then that means you get to ride everything in Magic Kingdom, shorter wait times, tons of free snacks, and the sun isn't trying to kill you. This is definitely a win-winw win-win. If you're staying at a deluxe level Disney resort during your vacation, then you might already have a version of after hours in your back pocket. Extended evening hours are available for deluxe level resort guests only on certain nights at certain parks, giving you two extra hours in the park after it closes for the general public. You will still need a general admission ticket to the parks to use this perk. And you're not going to get all the backto-back all-inclusive snacks, nor will you get the extra fireworks show. But hey, 2 hours more of park attractions and even fewer crowds is not too shabby when you have that option at your disposal already. Just be extra mindful of when and where extended evening hours are happening by checking up on them via the Disney World Hours and events calendar or by downloading our updated DFB 12-month calendar, which I just talked about earlier, and that might even be easier for you to navigate. Magic Kingdom also likes to celebrate all the little fun moments throughout the year that you won't need to make any extra purchases for beyond your theme park tickets. You might find some specialty green treats on the bakery shelves around St. Patrick's Day or see the Easter Bunny, Mr. and Mrs. Bunny actually meet and greet with guests around Easter weekend. Or if you don't mind Braving the Crowds, Magic Kingdom also does specialty evening fireworks around the 4th of July, too. Disney's Celebrate America, a Fourth of July concert in the sky, will play not once, not twice, but on three different nights of the Independence Day holiday weekend in 2026 from July 3rd to the 5th. Keep in mind that this fireworks show will replace Happily Ever After on those nights. So, if you'd rather see Happily Ever After and maybe have, I don't know, fewer people to worry about, then hang tight and book your Magic Kingdom Day post 4th of July weekend. More crowd-heavy celebrations happen in Magic Kingdom leading up to New Year's Day. Magic Kingdom celebrates the New Year countdown with their exclusive Fantasy in the Sky fireworks show in 2025. This show is going to happen on both December 30th and 31st, which we expect to happen for 2026 as well. Though, I definitely keep my eye on official dates once it gets closer to time. On both nights, the fireworks will take place twice at 7:30 p.m. and 11:50 p.m. Speaking of crowds, Disney crowds also tend to pick up around Run Disney race weekends. Ren Disney hosts several race weekend events throughout the year with distances ranging from 5ks to full marathons and several races will also cut through Magic Kingdom to make the walk, jog, run all the more memorable. The Walt Disney World Marathon weekend will happen January 7th to the 11th. The Disney Princess Halfmarathon weekend will happen shortly after that from February 26th to March 2nd. The Run Disney Springtime Surprise Weekend kicks off on April 16th to the 19th. And the Wine and Dine Half Marathon happens sometime towards the end of October. And then we've got the big ones, the party tickets. Magic Kingdom celebrates two big after hours holiday parties towards the end of each year. Mickey's Nots So Scary Halloween Party and Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party. While parties vary a little bit from year to year, we have full party videos out now for the events that we experience this year that'll give you a really good overview of what to expect next year. The main gist, think after hours events, but longer, with more holiday entertainment and seasonal overlays, exclusive characters, and different types of free treats like candy trails for Halloween and hot cocoa and cookies for Christmas. On the night of a holiday party, Magic Kingdom's going to close early for general admission guests by 6:00 p. p.m. So, keep that in mind if you're planning your trip, but you're not planning on going to one of the parties. Okay, we've made it to my favorite part of this video, are rapid fire truths about every single ride. There are a lot of reasons why Magic Kingdom is considered the best of the Disney World parks, but one of those is that it has double, more than double in some cases, the amount of rides versus what other Disney World parks can provide. So, here's what we're going to do. I'm going to take you around each land of Magic Kingdom to show you which rides are considered popular attractions, where lines can get super long, or filler attractions, where lines stay relatively manageable. Okay, let's go. In Fantasy Land, you've actually got a lot of filler rides here where wait times tend to be less than 30 minutes. These include It's a Small World, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, Mad Tea Party, Prince Charming Regal Carousel, Barn Stormer, and Under the Sea: Journey of the Little Mermaid. When it comes to Fantasy Land rides, you might want to prioritize first thing in the morning cuz their weights can get pretty long after the first hour of the day. Think Peter Pan's Flight and Seven Dwarfs Mine Train as your early theme park entry/ropppedrop gotos. Both of these rides can easily rack up 75 plus minute weights daily. Though between the two, Seven Doors tends to be more in demand with weights that could even push past the 2-hour threshold by the afternoon. Now, early theme park entry is available for all Disney guests staying at one of the Disney-owned hotels, giving you a 30inut head start to the day before the park's open to everyone else. You'll only be able to get on the rides in Fantasy Land and Tomorrowland during this time, aside from Tron, which is the outlier. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh is a tricky one to pin down in terms of priority ride versus filler ride. Sometimes the line is long, sometimes it's manageable. So, I'd say keep your eye on the My Disney Experience app and check Winnie the Pooh's forecasted wait time, which you'll be able to see by tapping on the ride itself via the app and going to its main page. That way, you'll know around the time when its Q-ine is predicted to be less busy that day. In Liberty Square, you've only got Haunted Mansion to worry about right now. And yes, this ride is often pretty popular. Much like Winnie the Pooh, it does have its moments where its lines can drop down to a much more reasonable weight, especially more towards the end of the night when people are getting ready to watch the fireworks. In Frontier Land, there's only Tiana's Bayou Adventure that you need to keep your sights set on right now until Big Thunder Mountain opens up later in the year. Because Tiana's is still a newish experience, ride lines tend to get pretty significant for this one, especially during the summer season or warmer days. So, I definitely say hitting up this one closer to rope drop would be the best way to experience it with the shortest weight. Unless you're getting multipass lightning lanes. More on those in just a sec. In Adventure Land, the Magic Carpets of Aladdin is definitely going to be a filler ride. Don't wait any longer than 15 minutes for this one, y'all. But remember that every once in a while, Aladdin and Jasmine come right at rope drop, and they like to ride this ride first. No, really. You might be able to ride it with them. Jungle Cruise is going to be your most popular ride in Adventureland with weights often averaging around 30 to 50 minutes. Weights do drop down for Jungle Cruise quite a bit by the end of the day. Once it's dark out, it can be a bit more difficult to see some of the animal animatronics, but then again, it makes the temple sequence of the ride pretty clear and eerie. Pirates of the Caribbean is a lot like Haunted Mansion when it comes to wait times, but all in all, this one tends to hover around 20 to 30 minutes on average. Not terrible in Disney speak. Finally, in Tomorrowland, filler rides are going to include Astro Orbiter, Tomorrowland Speedway, and People Mover. Welcome all members of the unofficial People Mover fan club. As your president, I must say, it's lovely to see y'all again. How are the kids? Tron Light Cycle Run and Space Mountain are the two most popular rides and coasters in the area, with Tron being the most popular of them all. It's not a bad idea to use your early theme park entry time to at least get in line for Tron, which you are allowed to do. You're not going to be able to ride it until the park officially opens, but you can get ahead of the queue and get all your stuff stowed in a locker during that time. Then again, if you hit up Space Mountain during early theme park entry, you'll just be able to walk right on it. So, totally your call. Lots of rides and lots of rides to try and prioritize. But if you want to make sure you hit up the bulk of these rides without waiting in forever long lines for them, your best course of action in the Magic Kingdom specifically is going to be to budget for Lightning Lanes. Lightning lanes upon first glance can sound like a lot to handle on top of all your itinerary planning that you're already trying to juggle. But once you get the hang of them, they're going to help you out instead of stress you out. There are three types of lightning lanes to choose from. You got multipass, single pass, and premier pass. But I'm going to focus my attention today on multipass and single pass. You can read more about Premier Pass and the other Lightning Lane strategies across the other Disney World parks by downloading our free guide to maximizing lightning lanes over at disneyfoodblog.com/multipass after this. Currently, what I'm going to do is focus on the most popular lightning lane selections and talk about how you can strategize them in the best possible way. Starting with our single pass options. Single pass is the alle cart version of lightning lanes. You'll pay one price per ride per person per ride through. This is available for two rides in Magic Kingdom Tron and Seven Dwarfs Mine Train. While you can purchase a single pass for both of these in a single day, that can get a little bit pricey for just two rides. So, you might want to choose one or the other. If given the choice, I'd probably choose Tron unless your group is made up of much younger members. That way, you can book a Lightning Lane return window for anytime after the sun sets. Unlike lots of Disney rides, Tron tends to see its highest weight times towards the end of the night since that's when you can see the grid canopy all lit up and looking really cool. Okay, moving on to Multipass. Now, Multipass gives you Lightning Lane selections for not just one ride, but lots of rides at a time. You'll be able to make three Multipass pre-selections 7 days before your hotel check-in if you're staying at a Disney hotel, or 3 days before your park visit if you're staying not in a Disney hotel. All your other multipass lightning lanes will be chosen the day of your visit. You can make another lightning lane selection right after you use the one you're currently holding. Meaning you can hold on to three multi passes at all times all day long. So in summary, choose three rides, head to the park, use one lightning lane, immediately book another, use one lightning lane, immediately book another. Dja vu, rinse and repeat till the end of the day. All right, good. So here's the next thing to keep in mind. When you're in the park, book whatever Lightning Lane you see pop up on the My Disney Experience app that'll work best for your group's itinerary. No questions, just book it. But when you're making those Magic Kingdom pre-selections, keep in mind that Jungle Cruise, Space Mountain, Peter Pants Flight, and Tiana's Bayou Adventure are all tier one attractions. That means you cannot pre-seelelect all three Lightning Lanes from that specific tier. You can choose one from tier one ahead of time, but the other two need to be from the tier 2 list of options. Tiers go away once you step into the park. So, if you book, say, Space Mountain as a pre-selection, but see a Peter Pan's flight selection pop up later on in the day, by all means, grab it. It's yours. So, which pre-selections from Tier 1 are the best pre-selections? Now, it's of course going to depend on your family's vibe, but in general, let's remember that both Space Mountain and Peter Pan's Flight can be accessed during early theme park entry, so you might be able to knock out one or both of those first thing in the morning. If your family's more about the thrills, consider booking Tiana's Bayou Adventure as your pre-selection. But if you've got some group members who are less than keen about dropping down a 50-ft plunge and getting soaked, Jungle Cruise might be a much better easygoing option. Okay, wait, I lied. This is my favorite part of this video. We've got the new, we've got the classics, we've got the food you'll have a hard time pulling me away from. The restaurants and snack stands that I've got for you today are going to be the stars of 2026. I feel it in my soul. For the record, if you've already got your DFB guide to Walt Disney World dining from the dfbstore.com website, or you're about to get it and you're planning on using that discount savings code YouTube to secure some major savings, wink wink, nudge nudge, then be sure to take a look at the specific Magic Kingdom section for not just the full list of snacks and restaurant locations, but also a clearcut list that'll show you which places use Disney dining plan credits, average restaurant price ranges for each location, which restaurants offer offer certain discounts, how tricky each restaurant is to make reservations for on a scale of 1 to five, and other nifty tidbits that'll help make your Disney dining decisions a whole lot easier to make, which is always our main goal. Okay, moving on to the newest stuff you're going to find in Magic Kingdom to eat this year. Beacon Barrel. We already mentioned Beacon Barrel, but yeah, that's the big new and noteworthy one and the one you've got to prioritize those reservations for. As Beacon Barrel story goes, a legendary pirate rum runner called Captain Meridian Mary Goldwin established this lively pirate pub alongside Rummy, her first mate and best feathered friend companion, who is going to keep an eye on the lounge from a roost at the top. This family-friendly tavern features options that are good for all ages, as well as immersive cocktails that are strictly for the 21 and over crowd. Note, there is a 45minute time limit for your time inside the Beacon Barrel just to make sure as many pirate patrons as possible have time to go eat, drink, and be merry. Now, Beacon Barrel might be the most noteworthy new guy on the block, but Astro Fizz kind of snuck into the Tomorrowland scene not too too long ago to offer up another location for your theme park typical snack items like popcorn and glazed nuts and frozen slushies, etc. But the real reason we keep coming back here is that there's a cherry cola churro on the menu. And it's weird, but not in a bad weird. It's just bizarre for a soda goblin like me to be eating her soda instead of drinking it. Alas, love that Disney World's finally expanding a little bit more in the churro department. Hopefully, that's an ongoing trend. And hopefully Disney World can take a few notes from Disneyland's churros to keep making these fried cinnamon dough sticks even better. So, what's popular in Magic Kingdom? This is Magic Kingdom. They want you to feel like royalty here, so it makes sense that the castles and the palaces would be the most popular in the park. Out of Disney's three palace/castle-like dining establishments, probably the easiest to book reservations for on a regular crowdle day are going to be Crystal Palace, right off of Main Street, USA. Crystal Palace is an elegantl looking table service buffet only steps away from Cinderella Castle. Here you're going to find items for lunch and dinner like seasonal pastas and shrimp creole, country fried chicken and gravy. So very diverse spread of kind of comfort food really. And for breakfast, expect the usual morning lineup. Eggs, bacon sausage along with a few key standouts like the Mickey Churro waffles. But the real stars of the show here are the 100 Acre Wood pals Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, and Tiger join the party to celebrate a very important day, friendship day. By the way, hate to ruin the specialness, but every day is friendship day for this group of stuffed animals, so you never have to miss out. Be Our Guest Restaurant over in Fantasy Land has reservations that can get a little pinchy sometimes, but lately reservations are easier to come by cuz it's really expensive here. Originally, Beast opened as a quick service option during lunch and a table service during dinner. But nowadays, we've lost our fabulous quick service lunch, and it's all expensive. You got prefixed dining for both lunch and dinner. Now $72 per adult, 43 per kid. Lunch and dinner both serve up French inspired cuisine like durac pork chops, ple rouge chicken, and filet minan. And while the food is fine, what you're really paying for is the atmosphere. The food here is a little more like think high-end wedding food, you know, but very kind of clearly mass- prodduced. That's kind of the vibe you're going to get. It's getting better, but that's still kind of what you're getting. So, like I said, what you're really paying for here is the atmosphere. Makes you feel like you're dining in the beast's castle. It is absolutely gorgeous in there. And the only way you can get in is by paying this crazy prefix price to get in. So, might be worth it to see inside. Be our guest restaurant is not a full character meal like you'll find at Crystal Palace, but there is a character experience that takes place. At some point during your meal, the beast will probably walk through the various dining rooms, but he won't stop for meet and greets. And then we've got the big one, the mother of all castle dining, the one that you'll have to lock in if you want to secure an advanced dining reservation 60 days before your trip. Cinderella's Royal Table inside the Cinderella Castle. This is Disney magic at its finest, y'all. Inside the castle, you'll be surrounded by scaling stone walls that are adorned with tapestries and art and stained glass windows. And this is one of those restaurants you're going to want to book if meeting the princesses is a huge deal for your group because you're going to be able to meet a swarm of them during the course of your meal. Starting with Cinderella, who you're going to get a photo op with even before you're seated. While princesses tend to rotate, some of the gals that swing by the castle most often are Rapunzel, Princess Aurora, and Jasmine. But we've also seen Merida, Ariel, Belle, and other fan favorites. So, you never know who is going to be there to say hello. If you book a meal for lunch or dinner, you're going to receive a prefix menu where you'll choose one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert. But if you don't mind getting up and around earlier, you can also dine here for breakfast. Still a prefix menu, but a cheaper price point for the exact same castle experience and princesses. And by cheaper, I mean you're still going to have to pay $76 per adult for the morning instead of $89 for lunch and dinner. Yeah, this could easily be the most expensive meal you eat all vacation. So, start saving if this is a priority or experience for you. Okay, if you've only got an hour before happily ever after, but your tummyy's rumbling for some snack rolls, Main Street USA always has sweet and savory snacks nearby. Along Main Street USA, you got Casey's Corner for hot dogs and corn dog nugs. Main Street Confectionary for specialty sweets, including custom popcorn creations, big old cookie pies, and a whole lot more. Where that came from, and the Plaza Ice Cream Parlor for, well, hopefully you can guess what's served up here. While you'll have to wait in physical lines for Plaza Ice Cream Parlor, you can mobile order from Casey's Corner in Main Street Confectionary ahead of time to skip over those ordering cues that tend to get even more dense right before the show starts. Okay, ready to talk about my favorite stuff in Magic Kingdom. I like a meal at Cinderella's Royal Table as much as the next royal subject, but if I'm being real with you now, that's definitely not where I'm going to go to find my absolute all-time favorite food inside this park. Turns out my favorite Magic Kingdom snacks and eats are going to cost you a whole lot less. Sometimes when I go to Magic Kingdom, I strictly eat inside Liberty Square and nowhere else. And why wouldn't I? There's the Sleepy Hollow refreshment snack window for my breakfast waffles, both sweet and savory. There's the Columbia Harbor House quick service for a lunch of surf and turf along with an extra basket of those tasty golden hush puppies. And there's the Liberty Tree Tavern. This is the family style restaurant with endless Thanksgiving eats and tomato baby chowing down on his little tomato as he watches and judges you from the frame picture nearby. Liberty Square might not be everyone's go-to favorite land in Magic Kingdom, but the restaurants here do not hold back. Sure, you can't find much on the menus at some snack locations, but what they lack in options, they make up for in quality. Take the spring roll cart right outside of Adventureland. The spring roll cart only ever sells two different flavors of spring rolls. But to make things more interesting, the spring roll flavors switch out sometimes. In the past, we've seen flavors here like Philly cheese steak and pepperoni pizza, pastrami and pepper jack, buffalo chicken. But the flavor that tends to stick around and not rotate out like the others is the legendary cheeseburger option, which tastes like a Big Mac shoved inside a fried crispy shell. Nothing offensive about that. Westward Hoe in Frontier Land has been a sleeper hit of mine for a while now. They're just always releasing some sort of treat that makes me go, \"Really, Westward Hoe? What are you doing?\" Currently on the menu for breakfast, Westward Ho has this Mickeyshaped bacon pecan caramel cinnamon roll that is soft and fresh and huge. It's the best Mickeyshaped cinnamon roll you'll find anywhere on property. It is swimming in caramel sauce. This cinnamon roll is living out my dream. There's also a candied bacon skewer on the menu. Random. available all day, not just during breakfast. And this is a shanked slab of pork coated in maple brown sugar and served with a side of chips to give it more crunch and savory appeal. Apparently, another all day offering here is the Joffre Coffee, which you can get hot or as a cold brew. Coffee lines are a whole lot shorter here than they are over at key coffee locations, even the main Joffrey's Revive kiosk in Tomorrowland. And if you want to jazz it up with an additional flavor, you're more than welcome to add caramel, hazelnut, vanilla, sugar-free vanilla, or whatever the seasonal offering might be for an extra 50ents. This is definitely a way to save on your coffee waiting in line time. But I still think my favorite place to grab a snack in Magic Kingdom is going to be Gaston's Tavern over in Fantasy Land. Again, small menu here, but everything available is going to hit the spot. There's literally nothing here I'd steer you away from. You want the gray stuffed cupcake? Good choice. Safe choice. You want the warm cinnamon roll? My favorite choice. You want the creme brulee croissant? My new favorite choice. You want the ham and grier sandwich? Love it. Gaston does like to switch things up every now and then. But even when we're sad to see one treat go, it's usually replaced by something equally as good, if not better. Okay, I admit it. For a girl who loves food, sometimes my main go-tos don't have me venturing outside of my comfort zone as often as I probably should. A basket of chicken tenders hates to see me coming. That's why I really don't mind munching my way around Magic Kingdom. The eights and sweets are pretty familiar for the most part, but Adventureland does help me step outside the dining box with its more unique assortment of options sometimes. Specifically, when I book a reservation over at Skipper Canteen, this restaurant is across the way from Jungle Cruise, which surprise is what this restaurant is based on. So, you know you're in for a pantastic meal. The eats here are more unusual and unique than what you'll find at most Magic Kingdom restaurants cuz they're inspired by cuisine from around the world. Some of her personal favorites are the hardy hard charu pork, the tastes like chicken because it is, and the false family falafel. There's also a secret menu you can ask your server about that changes up regularly, but more often than not, the powo Brazilian cheese bread is going to be your hidden menu gem here. And you know what? Since we're already in Adventure Land, let's head over and get a Dole Whip at Aloha Isle. I know there are a lot of places to grab Dolehip around property nowadays, but Aloha Isle walked, so all those other places could run. Aloha Isle has your standard pineapple Dole Whip on offer and specialty Dolehip desserts like the pineapple upside down cake and the occasional seasonal dolehip offering, too. But if you're looking for even more Dole Whip variety in the Adventureland area, head over to Sunshine Tree Terrace. It's also a solid option with a few more flavors beyond that standard pineapple, including options for customizable Dole Whip floats, soda, and Dole Whip. Yeah, count me in. Now that you got a taste for Magic Kingdom snacks, you're probably ready to see them all. Right. Right. It's okay to admit it. I'm right here with you, which is why the DFB team and I created the Magic Kingdom snack guide in the first place. This is an excuse to talk about literally every snack in Magic Kingdom. We've created ultimate snack guides for every park actually as featured on the dfbstore.com website. So you do have the choice to purchase them individually if you're just on the hunt for one or two or you can get our snack guide bundle for a highly discounted price to have access to the whole wonderful world of Disney World snacking. If you've got a hanker in for Disney entertainment beyond the rides, then guess what? Magic Kingdom's got that, too. So let's take a look at all the different shows that you can check out on your next visit. From the popular offerings to the ones that make you go, \"Really? I didn't know Disney offered that.\" The afternoons in Magic Kingdom are filled with popular characters and well-known songs and larger than life parade floats. You're going to find them all during Festival of Fantasy. While all the floats in this parade are highly impressive, and Flynn Riders got away with that smolder of his, the firebreathing Maleficent Dragon tends to be the highlight of this one. Maleficent shows up twothirds of the way through the parade. So, if you're watching it from start to finish, expect her to make her appearance around the 8 to 10 minute mark. Normally, Festival of Fantasy happens twice daily, but double check the My Disney Experience app at the start of your day, just in case those show times change. Okay, the Disney Adventure Friends Cavalcade. Think of this one like the samplesized version of a full-on Disney parade. Adventure Friends features Disney pals like Nick and Judy, Beloo, Miguel, Merida, Moana, Elena, Toy Story characters, Clarabel, and more. It is an eclectic mix. The Disney Starlight Dream the Night Away parade we already talked about a little bit earlier, but if you're looking for the specifics, the parade begins on Main Street, USA, and travels toward Frontier Land for its parade route. It's a reverse of the Festival of the Fantasy daytime parade route. It typically happens twice each night, once before Happily Ever After and once after the castle show, but again, double check show times for this one on the day of your visit. And the parade lasts approximately 12 minutes in any given viewing area. Another hidden gem, the Let the Magic Begin welcome show. Starting your day at rope drop in Magic Kingdom. Disney characters, including Mickey and Minnie, will gather in front of Cinderella Castle to help you kick off the day with music and magic and overall excitement for what's ahead. Now, this one's popularish. The Mickey's Magical Friendship Fair Castle Show. I say ish because even if you didn't know about this Cinderella Castle stage show, more than likely you'll be walking around the castle hub and stumble upon it anyways because it happens pretty frequently throughout the day. During Mickey's Magical Friendship Fair, Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, and Goofy are joined by characters from The Princess and the Frog, Tangled, and Frozen to sing songs and just celebrate everyone getting along and being all buddy buddy. The Main Street Philarmonic is Magic Kingdom's 12piece brass band and percussion ensemble. You'll encounter them playing and marching on Main Street USA and Storybook Circus throughout the day. And around 5:00 p.m., the Main Street Felarmonic performs the Star Spangled Banner during the daily flag retreat. This is another hidden gem of the park. The flag retreat is a special ceremony that takes place in town square as the American flag is retired for the evening. Members of the color guard will pass the flag to a guest veteran, followed by a procession on Main Street, making for a very sweet and goosebump worthy moment. The Dapper Dans are a well-known barberh shop quartet in the Disney circuit for sure. But if you don't swing by Main Street USA during one of their showtimes to see them, you'll miss out on the harmonizing ac capella ways, which is easier to do than you might expect. Again, again, again, check Showtimes on the My Disney Experience app. I don't want you to miss out on something you definitely want to see. Right outside the Casey's Corner Quick Service is a ragtime pianist that even takes Disney song requests. It's a perfect spot to take in some tunes right within view of Cinderella Castle. Magic Kingdom has several animatronic stage shows that are a great way to fill your afternoon because a they don't normally have too long of wait times, b they're indoors and airond conditioned, and c they're another classic piece of Disney entertainment at its finest. Animatronic stage shows in the Magic Kingdom include Hall of Presidents in Liberty Square, Country Bear Musical Jamberee in Frontier Land, Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room in Adventureland, and Carousel of Progress in Tomorrowland. Not every indoor stage show in Magic Kingdom is led by a cast of animatronics, though. For instance, the sight, sounds, and even sense of filler magic in Fantasy Land brings songs and scenes from popular Disney films to life in a whole new way. There's rarely ever a huge wait for this 4D movie. Plus, it's got some crisp AC for you to enjoy. Monsters in Glaf Floor uses audience participation to get the jokes rolling. If you're not super comfortable with being called out on the spot, you might want to skip this one. Although that means you're going to be missing out on the opportunity to be that guy if you know you know. Over in fantasy land, you can step inside the cottage of Maurice and Belle and through a magic mirror that is very cool to enjoy a live retelling of Beauty and the Beast with help from Lumiere, Mrs. Pots, Belle herself, and maybe even you. Enchanted Tales is not a traditional meet and greet location, but it is a fun and unique way to interact with some of your favorite characters straight from the castle. Now, happily ever after is the epitome of the Disney World experience. Stunning fireworks, memorable Disney songs, projections featuring iconic Disney film moments and characters, all taking place on and over Cinderella Castle. Please excuse me while I reach for my tissues. Allergy season is really getting to us lately. If you want to see the whole show with all the projections, it's best to stake out a spot on Main Street, USA about 30 minutes before all the hoopla begins. But if the projections really aren't a big deal for you and you're cool with just seeing the fireworks and hearing the music, then you can get a spot at the last minute behind Cinderella Castle around the Fantasy Land area for a much less crowded view of the spectacular. But I mean, they are fireworks. You can see them from all over Magic Kingdom. Personally, I love to watch this show from the People Mover. There are so many potential Disney friends for you to meet while you're in Magic Kingdom. So, let's talk characters. And this goes even beyond characters in the parades or in the restaurants or featured on the stage shows. I'm going to try to keep things brief here. Haven't had a lot of luck with that so far in this video. But there are so many friends who make their rounds regularly around this park. And I'm going to give you the quick lay of the meet and greet land as well as fill you in on how you can potentially meet other characters even beyond who I'm telling you about currently. On Main Street USA, this is where you're going to find that iconic Mickey Mouse meet and greet over at Town Square Theater. But over on the town square porch, you're often going to meet other characters, too, like one of the Disney princesses. Fantasy Land, no shocker here, is going to be your main meet and greet hub. The big one is Princess Fairy Tale Hall, where you can meet princesses like Rapunzel and Tiana, Cinderella, as well as the occasional visiting princess, who may take the place of one of the regularly scheduled princesses. You never know who's going to be in town. Pete's silly sideshow in Storybook Circus is a great way to meet the rest of the Fab Five, excluding Mickey. while they're all dressed up in their performers attire. So, that's going to be Donald, Daisy, Minnie, and Goofy. Now, you can meet Ariel over at Ariel's Grotto. Who would have thought? Mirabel spends her days in Fairy Tale Garden, located on the right-hand path when you're walking past Cinderella Castle. And speaking of Cinderella Castle, you'll often find the wicked stepsisters, Anastasia and Draella, hanging out near Cinderella Fountain. Don't want to pay to eat at Crystal Palace in order to see a silly willy-nilly old bear? Winnie the Pooh and Tiger make regular appearances right outside the many adventures of Winnie the Pooh. And Peter Pan sometimes shows up near his ride, too, outside of Peter Pan's flight. Meanwhile, over in Tomorrowland, this is going to be your prime location to meet Stitch, who tends to wander, but sometimes we'll have a little stationary meet and greet spot near Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger Spin. Adventure Land is home to Aladdin and Jasmine, who will spend time meeting with new and old friends alike over at the Agriba Bazaar near the Magic Carpets of Aladdin ride. And be on the lookout for Captain Jack Sparrow, who sometimes hangs out nearby the Pirates of the Caribbean ride when he's not searching for rum, of course. Throughout the day, you never know who you're going to encounter next. So, be sure to check the My Disney Experience app and the information boards posted around the park for characters and their appearance times. I've definitely seen Alice and the Mad Hatter over by the teacups. We've seen Gaston over by Gaston's Tavern. You just never know who's going to show up. Oh, and sometimes you might find out that one or several of those lovable country bears are going to be hanging around outside their stage show in Frontier Land. Now, recently we've been seeing a whole lot more of the fairy godmother, who is now doing one-on-one meet and greets inside Bibbidity Bobbidity Boutique, but you might get lucky and catch her outside of the boutique on occasion over in Fantasy Land as well. So, Bibbidity Bobbidity, what now? Magic Kingdom is far from your typical amusement or theme park. Meaning, you're going to find some pretty quirky and out there experiences that you won't find at other non-D Disney theme parks. Maybe not even at other Disney theme parks either. So, if you're looking for the most unique add-ons for your Magic Kingdom Day, here's a list for you to choose from. Bibbidity Bobbidity Boutique is one of those once in a-lifetime things that you'll want to make reservations for before your kids age out of the experience. This is for ages 3 to 12 only. There are different packages and different price points that you can choose from, but each package will give your kiddo the opportunity to star in their own magical fairy tale for the next 90 minutes as their very own fairy godmother pampers them with makeup and hairstyles and costumes and accessories that you're going to want to take a gazillion pictures of. If you need a little extra pirate training before your reservation at the Beacon Barrel, then you'll want to make your way over to the Crows Nest and join in on a scavenger hunt called A Pirates Adventure: Treasures of the Seven Seas. At this little building right outside of the Adventure Land entrance coming from Frontier Land, you'll receive a free treasure map in Talisman where you'll need to follow the clues to solve each mystery. Once you collect all five cards in the game, you'll get a sixth card signed by Captain Jack himself. Now, this is completely free and anybody can do it. Smells on Parade is a complimentary familyfriendly search and sniff adventure where guests will become Timothy Q Mouse's whiff assistants to help out Dumbo's newest act. Just stop by the ticket booth near Big Top Souvenirs and New Fantasy Land for a free guide map to get started. Harmony Barber Shop is a vintage style salon inside Main Street, USA, where all ages can go and get their haircut. But the most memorable part of this experience is taking your little one to go get their very first haircut in Disney World. The My First Haircut Experience starts at $28 and includes not only the haircut, but also a commemorative Mickey ear hat, a keepsake lock of hair, and an official milestone certificate. Magic Kingdom doesn't have one fireworks dessert party or two fireworks dessert parties. It has three. But no matter which you choose, each one's going to give you a variety of desserts and cheeses and beverages, alcoholic and non, to enjoy over at Tomorrowland Terrace and VIP viewing of the Happily Ever After Fireworks Show. The differences between the three parties are when you'll get to enjoy your spread of desserts and where you'll go for your VIP viewing. For the pre and post dessert party, you'll be led to a standing area in the plaza garden to watch the fireworks. And for the seats and sweets party, you'll get to stay in the Tomorrowland Terrace to have VIP viewing from the comfort of the seats out on the restaurant's patio. You can probably piece together the difference between the prefireworks dessert party and the postfireworks dessert party by yourself. But just to make it 110% clear, the pre-party serves desserts before the show and the postparty serves desserts after the show. And as for the seats and sweets party, you'll get to enjoy your desserts during the show. Again, from the comfort of a table and chair. The Keys to the Kingdom Tour is a 5-hour walk-in guided experience, offering behindthe-scenes access to some of Magic Kingdom's most hidden areas. One of the big tour highlights includes VIP access to the famous, but only seen by cast members, util tunnels. constructed underneath Magic Kingdom. Prices for the tour are about 169 to 189 per person on top of your regular day ticket, but that price does also cover lunch and a commemorative gift. Okay, you asked, so I'm going to answer. Y'all have been giving me some really tough questions to address about Magic Kingdom, so hopefully these answers finally give you the clarity you've been looking for. First question, how distracting is the construction really? I mean, it makes a pretty big dent in the back of the park, and that's definitely an eyes sore. The Rivers of America is dearly missed, but the water won't be gone for good just during all the construction. That being said, when it comes to big attractions, the only thing being impacted by the back of park construction at the moment is Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, and that should reopen sometime next year. So, the construction isn't pretty, but it's not taking away all those big rides and experiences that you probably have at the top of your priority list anyway. Next question. What is truly the best angle for happily ever after? Well, in past Magic Kingdom videos of ours, we've talked about all the different angles you can watch Happily Ever After. You can watch the Happily Ever After Fireworks from minus the intense crowds behind the castle in Fantasy Land, riding an outdoor ride like Astro Orbiter, Tiana's Bayou Adventure, on the beach side of the nearby Polynesian Village Resort. Honestly, there are lots of places that'll give you a clear view of just the fireworks. But if you're looking for the whole kitten kaboodleoodle with fireworks and castle projections and projections down the storefronts lining Main Street, USA, there's no way around it. You got to be on Main Street and plan to brave the crowds. Personally, I like to be right there in the hub, especially if I want to see everything. So, I'll be up there near Plaza Restaurant and uh Casey's Corner usually. But if you want to be sure to get out of the park as quickly as possible, that's when you want to take Bria's advice and stand back by the flag pole, then you can kind of escape as soon as those fireworks are done going off. Next question. Does Magic Kingdom actually have the worst park food? Well, I guess it depends on who you're talking to. Magic Kingdom has the safest food that most picky eaters are going to be fine with, which is why I hyped up Skipper Canteen earlier, because that's really going to be your best bet for adventurous dining, aside from the new Beacon Barrel, which is also in Adventure Land. But when it comes to getting the absolute best food on Disney property, even the signature Cinderella's Royal Table, which costs tons of money, is typically fine when it comes to entre, right? Again, many of these Magic Kingdom locations have you paying for the overall immersion factor, not necessarily the high quality dining. So, if you're someone who would rather pay more on a good meal rather than an interactive one, I'd say save your big dinner money for a restaurant that's going to give you a really highquality entree like California Grill, a Contemporary Resort, or Lelia and Abcott, Hollywood Brown Derby, Hollywood Studios, lots of restaurants in Disney Springs, and lots of hotel restaurants as well. I think the best dining in all of Disney World is going to be found in Disney Springs and at the hotels. Next question. If you could only do one thing in Magic Kingdom, what? People mover. Sorry, was that too eager? People mover. Yes, a thousand times over. This is the correct answer for all of those who are a part of our unofficial People Mover fan club. But all joking aside, I am not joking. I really do love the calm pockets of peace you can find around Magic Kingdom that don't draw nearly the crowds of some of the other attractions. People mover definitely being one of them. I'd also be happy as a clam just grabbing a dole whip from Aloha Isle, watching the enchanted tiki room, calling it a day. So, here's your reminder to find the little things around Magic Kingdom in the midst of your jam-packed park day. And be sure, be sure to appreciate those cast members and the magic that they make every single day in Walt Disney World. Tell them thank you. Give them cast member compliments on your My Disney Experience app. and just be sure to recognize them for the hard work that they do. Okay, Magic Kingdom folks, if you're planning on going to this park in 2026, then shout out the one thing you're looking forward to about your visit the most in the comments so that we can get hyped up with you. We got lots more Magic Kingdom videos where that came from. So, be sure to check out some of our other planning videos next, like what you need to know before you eat in Magic Kingdom or our Magic Kingdom bucket list video. And don't forget to download that free Disney World 12-month calendar of ours over at disneyfoodblog.com/wdwcal. Thanks for listening everyone and thanks for watching. As always, this is AJ for Disney Food Blog and we'll see you real soon."

      "transcript": "Universal Orlando is going to be a hot spot for vacationers in 2026. Bags are packed, Universal tickets are booked, and our Minion goggles are at the ready. But where should we stay on Universal property for the best theme park perks, dining, pools, and rooms? We're ranking every Universal Orlando hotel today from okay to best ever here on DFB Guide. Hey everybody, it's AJ for Disney Food Blog. Universal Orlando made quite the splash in 2025 when it opened up that brand new park, Epic Universe, but is going to continue making waves on into 2026 as more and more people choose to prioritize these parks over the Disney World ones. While Disney's under major construction mode for the foreseeable future, so the big question we're answering today is which Universal hotels are the best ones to stay in next year. In order to find our answer, we're ranking every hotel and ending the video with our number one choice. So, join us as we go worst to first for Universal Orlando hotels. Okay, just because Endless Summer is on the bottom of our list today, that doesn't mean I'm mad at it. Some of y'all out there might still prefer this option over some of Disney's value resorts. Endless Summer is Universal's value hotel option that's made up of two different sections, Surfside and Dock Side. But regardless of which side you stay in, you're going to experience major beachy tropical vacation aesthetics overall. Much like Disney's Value Hotels, you've got food court options to choose from here, which actually have a fair mix of standard theme park eats along with some substantial comfort foods that are a little more unique, like citrus roasted chicken and shrimp pobo. But don't expect much more in the dining department beyond the food courts. The standard rooms in general, nothing to write home about, but they are modern and clean and have a little more space to them than your average standard room setup. Minus the beds that you can fold up into the walls when you need more wiggle room during the day. Unless summer does not have those. That being said, they do have two-bedroom suite options. Yep, I said what I said, two-bedroom, that'll give you a whole lot more room if the standard one's not up to snuff, giving you the option to sleep up to a family of six for a much more affordable price point. Unlike Disney's Family Value Suites available at Allstar Music and Disney's Art of Animation, these two-bedroom options still only have one bathroom to share, though you'll have two sink counter spaces, which is nice. However, the prices for these suites tend to cost less than the family value suites at Disney, often hovering around the 300 to 350 per night range, while the standard Endless Summer rooms will put you back around 150 to 250 per night. So, might be worth a slight extra splurge here just for that additional wiggle room. All in all, Endless Summer is not a bad resort. It's affordable for families and still has lots of the same Universal perks as the other Universal area hotels, including free shuttle transportation between the parks and early theme park admission when it's available. That being said, Endless Summer is also the farthest away from Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios Florida. One of the many perks about staying with a Universal property in this general area is the easy walking access to either of those two classic parks, as well as the Citywalk District. But if you're going to walk to these sections from Endless Summer, it would more than likely take you about 20 to 25 minutes to get there one way. And that's still way closer than some of the other Disney hotels will give you for their theme parks, especially for a value price point. So that might still be fine for you. Another downside to staying at Endless Summer, is the fact that pool hopping is not allowed. That's pretty common territory on the Disney World scene, but when it comes to the Universal hotels that are closest to CityWalk, most of them give you the option to hop between each other's hotel pools. While you're still more than welcome to visit other Universal hotels as an Endless Summer guest, Endless Summer continues to be the only hotel in this Universal area that doesn't give you any pool hopping privileges. That being said, you still will be able to hop between the Surfside and do side pool options, which may be more than enough for your family anyway. Oh, by the way, don't stress over taking notes today. Just scan the QR code you see on the screen now or click on the link in the description for Disneyfoodblog.com/universal ranks so we can send you our full ranked Universal Hotel list with the highlighted pros and cons. That way you won't forget what we talked about when it's time for you to start making your final Universal Hotel decisions. Next up, Aventura Hotel. What's the theme for the prime value Aventura? Sleek, modern, chrome, and the future and all that jazz. Amateur is very focused on the whole chic windowed tower vibe. If you're looking for a hotel with a whole lot of character and whimsy, this probably isn't going to be the place to make you feel warm and fuzzy inside. That being said, there's still a lot of nice stuff going for it. Depending on the room you choose, you can get some gorgeous views of Volcano Bay out of your window, specifically from those skyline view rooms. Rooms are relatively smaller here. You've got your standard setup. You've got your deluxe level rooms, which will provide you with slightly more square footage to spread out. And you've got your kids suites. Now, kids suites are a really nice addition to the Universal Hotel scene. These provide separate rooms made just for the kids so that kids and parents can have their own spaces to lounge around in. Kind of like the Shoppers in Training shopping carts that you'll find at the select grocery stores. Kids get to have the freedom to be a kid while still feeling empowered with something made just for them in mind. All the while, the adults get a little more breathing room and thinking space, so everybody wins. The problem with Aventura's kids suites, however, is that they are, how do I put this nicely? Boring. That wasn't nice. But I can't take it back now. You'll see throughout the course of this video just how cool kids suites can be across some of these other hotels. And while kids suites are generally cheaper at Aventura, I'd almost prefer just to get a two-bedroom at Endless Summer for a smidgen more whimsy. When it comes to dining and drinks, you've got a few more options than you'll find at Endless Summer, including a Barentura lobby bar, the Bar Soul Pool Bar, the Urban Pantry food court style selections, and a Starbucks for your Frappuccino hit in the morning. But probably our favorite place to snack and drink at Aventura is going to be the Bar 17 Beastro perched on top of the Aventura Hotel to give you breathtaking views along with your custom crafted cocktails and Korean inspired bites like bow, vegetable stirfry, and more. So, Avaturura is affordable. It's sleek. It has great window views and tasty cocktails, but it's not going to be the most exciting option for kids or any guest who's looking to add a little more whimsy to their Universal vacation. Now, if you are a fan of the nostalgic vibes towards Disney's Pop Century Resort, but you're still intrigued by the whole endless summer concept we mentioned at the start of this video, then the Cabana Bay Value Hotel might be the perfect happy medium for you. Cabana Bay takes beach and retro theming and mixes them together to create some super fun summer vacation vibes for the whole family. While Cabana Bay will let you do pool hopping, you may not want to since the two pools featured here are massive and have impressive features. The Atomic Pool has a large slide that kind of gives me Men in Black Alien Attack vibes. Anyone else feeling that way? Well, the Hideaway pool has a full-on lazy river. We love a lazy river around here. Don't want to swim? That's cool. Maybe you'd rather take up a game of bowling instead. Yep, Cabana Bay is home to Galaxy Bowl, where you can rent a lane for 45 minutes for one to three players, or 75 minutes for groups of four to eight. Adults cost $17. Children 9 and under cost 11, but there is an additional speed bowling option that'll give players a quick 20 minutes of lane time for about $9 each. Along with the bites you can order from Galaxy Bowl, Cabana Bay also has the Bayiner Diner food court, the Shakes, malt shop, and a few different pool bars and lounges for you to check out, as well as a Starbies, of course. Is the food anything to write home about here? Not really. But will it get you fed and provide you with a nice variety of options? Yeah. Once again, a Cabana Bay room could give you some pretty sweet views across Volcano Bay, depending on where your room is situated. Cabana Bay rooms come in a variety of styles. Some are motel style rooms where the door faces outside and others have hallways that face inside like a standard hotel. The rooms here range from standard two queen or one king rooms if you're looking for the most affordable option, but you can also splurge a little for more space by booking a family suite that can sleep up to six or even one of the two-bedroom suites that sleep up to eight. And by splurge, I mean $500 plus per night for the two-bedroom option. The regular family suites tend to stick around the 200 to 350 price range. I think the biggest drawback with booking a room at Cabana Bay is just how sprawling this resort is. Depending on where your room is located, the layout makes it kind of hard and confusing to get around. That being said, walking over to Volcano Bay is a breeze from this place, especially if you're over in the Bayside building. More tropical vibes incoming, but this time we're taking a trip to the Caribbean. While the Caribbean theming throughout the Sapphire Falls signature hotel isn't as prominent as you'll find it to be at Disney's Caribbean Beach, it still comes through thanks to blue waterfalls and steel drum soundtracks and Caribbean themed dining options, lounges and bars with rare vintage rums and beautiful lagoon style pool and beachball themed chandelier in the main lobby. Okay, not actually sure if beachball chandeliers are really a Caribbean specialty or not, but I wanted to mention it regardless just cuz it's cool. Now, when you book a room at Sapphire Falls, you got a handful of different options to choose from beyond the standard style setup. Just keep in mind that the suite options are a little smaller than many of the suite options offered across the other Universal hotels. Ironically, the biggest rooms here don't necessarily accommodate the most guests. For example, the hospitality suites are 1,355 square ft, but only feature a king bed. It can accommodate up to three people, but that's only if you ask for a rollway to be brought up to the room. And considering these rooms can get up to $900 plus per night, the hospitality suite splurge doesn't really feel worth it, especially when you consider that a stay at this hotel does not come with a free express pass unlimited perk, much like you'll find at the other signature hotels. That's not to say the rooms at Sapphire Falls aren't fun to stay at. They definitely go hard on the ocean vibes in each space. And if you book a room with a pool or lagoon view, you'll increase your chances of getting a view across the Islands of Adventure Park, too. Speaking of which, walking to the theme parks from this hotel is easy. You got a clear walkway that'll lead you over to the citywalk area/the park front gates in about 10 to 15 minutes at an average walking pace. Not including Epic Universe, of course, which is in its own little bubble away from the main Universal Orlando hub. But much like any of the Universal Orlando hotels, you can always rely on the free shuttle services to take you to and from where you need to go. Sapphire Falls also has additional boat transportation over to the CityWalk area just in case you want to save yourself some steps. The dining options are another key highlight for Sapphire Falls. Specifically speaking, Amatista Cookhouse and Strongwater Tavern. Amitista is a table service restaurant that serves fresh island inspired dishes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And these include stuff like omelette stations and bottomless bloody maryries and mimosas in the morning and ancho chili chicken empanadas, island fish sandwiches and a half mojo marinated rotisserie chicken in the afternoon and evening. Meanwhile, remember that rare rum I briefly mentioned earlier? You'll find the good stuff over at Strongwater Tavern along with a variety of small plates to go along with it like tuner tartar, aros koo, pork belly tacos, and more. Sapphire Falls definitely feels like a sophisticated stay, but the main things keeping it from ranking any higher on today's list are the limited guest space in the rooms, plus the missing Express Pass perks, despite the higher than normal room prices. And now we're getting into the free unlimited Express Pass territory. Royal Pacific is one of the three Universal signature hotels that comes with complimentary unlimited express passes for your group's visits to Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure only, not Epic Universe at this time, but I'll be sure to let you know if that status changes. Express passes are Universal's version of a quick cue that lets you bypass the main ride lines in exchange for much shorter ride lines. With standard express passes, you'll only be able to skip the ride lines once per day, but with unlimited, you'll be able to skip them as many times as you want. Considering the fact that unlimited express passes can cost upwards of $150 to $350 plus per person per day, suddenly that $600 per night stay for a standard signature universal hotel room doesn't seem nearly as bad if you are already planning on paying for express passes out of pocket for everyone in your room. These rooms might even wind up saving you money when all is said and done. Along with the unlimited express passes, Royal Pacific will also give a once again nice, lush, tropical setting to stay in. Don't worry, we're about to look at some really unique hotel themes that go beyond the tropical thing here in a second, but for now, enjoy the abundance of palm trees and tiki drinks. Royal Pacific is another resort that's a hop, skip, and a jump away from the CityWalk/I Islands of Adventure/ Universal Studios Florida Trinity. You can either take a short walk, about 10 to 15 minutes at an average walking pace, or you can take a boat ride to the shopping district area instead. And of course, you can take a shuttle over to Epic Universe, too. Along with standard rooms and suites that are similar to the layouts I've already mentioned today, there are two special style rooms I want to shout out here at Royal Pacific. The first are the club level rooms which come with additional amenities including private club level lounge access, continental breakfast, evening or derves and personal concier service. Is the club level status worth the extra splurge that could cost you at minimum over $700 per night? Eh, to each their own. Personally, the folks on our team don't tend to be head over heels with the all-inclusive snacks and drinks provided by the Royal Pacific's Club level lounge, but you still might prefer to have them conveniently offered throughout your stay. The second room I want to mention are the kids suites here. I'm about to show you why I said Aventura's kids suites are kind of boring when compared to the other Universal kids suites. Because the kids suites at Royal Pacific are themed around Jurassic World. Yep, it's the Jurassic Park theme song suddenly invading your headsp space the moment you lay eyes on this room. The twin beds inside the Jurassic World kids suite are made up to look like the gyrosphere vehicles featured in the latest franchise. And the door connecting the parents room to the kiddos's room is themed to look like a dino enclosure. Warning adults not to feed the dinos. Despite the cool sweet theming, I do have to mention that some of the Royal Pacific rooms and suites are a bit less spacious than you'll find at other Universal Hotel signature suites. But the Jurassic World theming might help make up for that, especially if you've got a Dino fan in the family. When it comes to food, the dining is actually pretty topnotch. Tuk Tuck Market is a grab-and-go spot that sells coffee, snacks, pastries, and other quick service type specialty items. Their signature item is a tuk tuk pastry, which is like a homemade Pop-Tart and a variety of sweet and savory flavors. Now, my script writer, Bria, will be highly disappointed to learn that these pastries are also frosted, which further proves my point that frosted Pop-Tarts are better than the naked ones, though I don't think she's going to budge on her opinion. Alas, we persist. Be on the lookout for other items at this little quick service, too, like hot walks, sandwiches, hand scoop frozen treats, and other goodies as well. Also off the lobby is the Orchid Lounge restaurant. They're open in the evenings and are known for their signature cocktails and sushi. Downstairs, you're going to find Jake's American Bar, which is a sit-down spot known for its burgers and beer and puffy pretzel rods. Across from Jake's is the island dining room, where you can grab breakfast and dinner, table service style. Their big kahuna breakfast is one of the most noteworthy items on the menu, featuring a sampling of their most popular morning lunches. But what's probably the coolest dining option here, if not the coolest dining option across any of the Universal hotels, is the Wanttoan Luau dinner show that happens on Saturdays at 6 PM. As far as the pool scene is concerned, it's okay. I've definitely seen cooler, and I definitely prefer the options at Cabana Bay 10fold, but the ship setting is neat, and I do love that you can rent a private cabana here if you plan on spending your day swimming and floating and hanging out by the pool bar. Time to switch gears. So long, tropical hotel settings, and say hello to rock and roll. Hard Rock Hotel has a lot going for it, so I'm going to try to cover as much ground as I possibly can without talking your ear off. The three main things you need to know about Hard Rock is that a this is a signature hotel decked out in rock and roll highlights with outfits, instruments, and other memorabilia straight from singers, bands, and musicians that have been hot on the charts throughout the decades. This is another one of the three Universal hotels that'll give you unlimited express passes for everyone in your room. And this hotel was recently renovated, which means bright, shiny new rooms to stay in, but potentially higher price points, too. So, watch out for those costly spikes. Now, I can talk about everything else, which is just the icing, sprinkles, gravy, and cherries on top. Hard Rock Hotel is the closest hotel to Universal Studios Florida. So, if you want to be within short walking distance to those front gates, Hard Rock is only going to be a 10-minute walk away, cuz music is all the rage here. You got a lot of awesome exclusive music perks to check out, too. The Sound of Your State program is a big one. This is where you can reserve a turntable with curated records and/or a Fender guitar and headphones to play in your room, complete with tutorials on the TV if you aren't sure how to play. During your pool day, don't be shocked if you dunk your head under the water and hear rock and roll tunes coming from the underwater speakers. And if you decide to splurge, and I mean really splurge, on a Graceand suite, you'll be able to sleep up to seven people. You'll receive club level privileges, and you'll get two separate bedrooms and two separate bathrooms. And you'll get an oversized tub, a walk-in closet, a glass fireplace, four flat screen TVs, a personal gym, and a baby grand piano. You know, for good measure. The Graceand Suite will put you back thousands of dollars to stay in per night. So, you might be peachy just sticking with the cheapest standard room option available here, which will still put you back well over 700 per night. But, Hard Rock Hotel also has kids suites called Future Rockstar Suites, where you'll find a big red curtain pulled back to reveal hundreds of exciting fans ready for your kid to make their grand debut on stage. Maybe not as exciting as Jurassic World, but hey, life's a stage, I suppose. And this is just a bit more on the nose. There are quite a few restaurants and lounges in the Hard Rock Hotel area, too, including sit-down locations like The Kitchen and The Palm Restaurant. We actually recently went to the kitchen after hearing about their massive kitchen sink cake, which is seven layers of brownie, peanut butter cream, chocolate chunk cookie, red velvet cake, vanilla cheesecake, devil's food chocolate cake, and vanilla chiffon served with chocolate sauce and vanilla bean ice cream. And that comes to a whopping total of $48. Yeah, you thought cake bake shops cakes over at Disney's Boardwalk in were pricey? Well, they are. It's just this kitchen sink cake is even more so. If you're looking to grab and go a few snacks and not spend nearly 50 bucks on cake, you can stop by Emic and Bolios. Or you can chill out by the pool with eats and drinks from the beach club. Nope, there's not a Hard Rock Cafe attached to this hotel, but the Hard Rock Cafe inside CityWalk is again a very short walk away. Okay, are you ready for the new stuff? This is our first brand new hotel hitting our uh rankings here. Teruna is one of three new hotels in the Epic Universe area. So that means you're not going to be able to walk right up to the gates of Islands of Adventure or Universal Studios Florida or CityWalk from here, but you're going to be so much closer to the brand new park and you'll still be able to take a shuttle over to the other parks whenever you need to get back and forth. Initially, we were a little worried about the price tags for three brand new hotels so close to Epic. But surprise, Teral Luna is a prime value resort, so it's actually relatively affordable. In fact, Teraluna tends to be the most affordable of the three Epic Universe area hotels, typically ranging around 130 to 170 per night. Now, the reason Teraluna tends to be cheaper than its siblings is because its walking paths up to Epic Universe aren't as convenient. Yep, you can still walk to the park from this resort, but you will have to cross some roads in order to reach it, which could take up to 20 to 30 minutes at an average walking pace. That being said, you can still take an Epic Universe shuttle to the park instead, which will only be a short puddle jump away. Now, I got caught up in the transportation stuff, and I forgot to tell you how cool this hotel looks. Teruna is a galactic themed resort with a focus on planetary elements in the lobby, cosmic inspired dining options, and solar system influences in the rooms. So basically space, space, and more space. But do the rooms have space beyond the overall theming? For the most part, yes is. I mean, the rooms definitely don't feel cramped if you're a family of two to three. But if you're looking for more room beyond the standard setup, so beyond one king bed or two queen-siz beds, you'll probably still want to stick with a Universal Hotel that has the suite options. Dining isn't over the top here, but you do have options across the Omega Cafe and Market quick service, featuring stuff like burgers and paninis, fried chicken and pastas. Moonrise Bar and Grill offers quesadillas, salads, and more burgers. And Luna Bar is the lobby's watering hole, and there's directto room pizza delivery. When it comes to the pool, it's a very big zero entry pool, but you're not going to find water slides or lazy rivers or any kind of over-the-top theming that goes along with the space vibes. It's just a nice pool. Teraluna is basically a solid addition to the Universal Hotel lineup and is one of the best value hotels that'll keep you super close to all the Epic Universe action. But as you might have noticed, well, it's towards the top of our overall Universal Hotel list today, it's also on the bottom when it comes to the Epic Universe Hotel Trinity. And you'll see why very, very soon. But first, let's talk about my favorite Universal Hotel that's still in the classic Universal area, Portoino Bay. Portoino Bay is this classy Italian seaside village inspired signature resort. And it's also the final Universal hotel on this list that'll provide you with those free express passes. You got a lot of different room options here, including standard rooms, club level rooms, suites, and rooms that have a lovely little outdoor balcony to spend your mornings on, looking out across Harbor Piaza and sipping away on your hot coffee or tea. I know, idyllic, right? All of this looks super sophisticated so far, but what if I told you this could possibly be the preferred hotel choice for not just the adults, but for the kids, too. Yep, kids suites are available to book at Portoino. And these kids suites are Despicable Me themed. So, that means your kids are going to get to sleep in these non-exlosive probably bombs surrounded by hundreds of minion eyes because who wouldn't get a good night's sleep with lots of little yellow dudes gathered around you? Portoino Bay is also home to various upscale dining options with a focus on Italian cuisine. There's Madela's Restaurante for table service, Trateria del Porto, Splendido Bar and Grill, and Sal's Market Deli for quick and casual dining. The Thirsty Fish for light bites and drinks, a gelato, and a Starbucks. Just assume that if you're staying at a Universal Hotel, there'll never be a Starbucks too far away. But my favorite restaurant at Portoino is Biche Restorante, which is a dimly lit, sophisticated restaurant that features Italian inspired dishes with handmade pastas and seasonal risottos. Now, this resort is pretty spread out, so getting place to place can be a little bit of a trick, especially if your room's on one of those outer wings on the far opposite side of where the lobby is. That being said, this resort still has a clear walking path up to the Citywalk area that'll take you about 15 to 20 minutes at an average walking pace. Otherwise, shuttles and boats are available for you to use, too. Portoino Bay Resort is also home to three pools, but the beach pool is the main one with the actual sand around the perimeter and a Roman aqueduct themed water slide. And much like Disney's Grand Fian Resort, Portoino Bay also has premium spa services in case you need a little more pampering while you're on vacation. I love how Portoino Bay can combine character, whimsy, and sophistication into one big hotel package that's good for the whole family. But I will say be prepared to budget for this all ages luxury stay since the cheapest standard room prices often range between 700 to 800 per night. Okay, we are at Teraluna's twin sister, Stella Nova. Stellanova is another brand new prime value hotel in the Epic Universe area. And upon first glance, it looks almost identical to Teraluna. And in a lot of ways, it's very similar. They both got modern amenities, fitness centers, lobby bars, quick service restaurants, galactic theming inside the rooms, similar standard room setups, a spacious pool, but the two key differences between them are what makes Stellenova stand out. The first, there's a designated walking path to Epic Universe from Stellanova that doesn't require you to play multiple rounds of Frogger like you'll have to do when you're crossing over from Teral Luna. We tested this path out ourselves and it takes around 5 minutes to walk from the front of the hotel to the crosswalk that'll take you across the street straight up into the entrance of Epic Universe. Not too shabby, especially when you consider that average prices for a room at Stelenova tend to range at 200 to 230 per night. The other key difference, the overall space theming inside tends to be more drastic and dramatic, while the theming in Teraluna is more casual and subdued. Now, you might prefer the casual theming of Terra Luna, but we really do love how Stella has an entrance that makes you feel like you're entering a black hole and the stars on the ceiling and the hallways and even the rooms with the darker and enhanced space theme. This is already probably obvious since I mentioned it when we talked about Teraluna before, but Stellanova is only within walking distance to Epic Universe. If you want to travel to the other Universal theme parks, you're going to have to take the shuttle system, which is about a 15-minute ride over. Not horrible, but still something to keep in mind when planning out your day-to-day itineraries. All right, Helios Grand, we have officially granted you the title of best Universal Hotel for 2026. So, give yourself a round of applause. There's a lot of good stuff to say about the new signature Helios Grand. Team members at Helios refer to this hotel as the crown jewel of Epic Universe's Celestial Park. And that's because the hotel is actually situated inside Celestial Park, making it the first ever Universal Orlando Hotel to have a designated entrance directly into a theme park. So, if you're wanting to get to Epic Universe with absolutely zero travel time, Helios Grand is going to be your go-to resort. And I will tell you, having stayed there, it makes a massive difference to just be able to walk directly into the theme park. You don't think it's going to be that big a deal? It's a big deal. This hotel is heavily influenced by the Mediterranean decor and constellations that create Celestial Park, making that transition from hotel to Epic incredibly fluid. You've got quite a few dining opportunities in Helios Grand. But our two favorites have got to be the Flora Tivera, the full service restaurant serving up Mediterranean comfort foods for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. and the rooftop bar called Bar Helios, which serves up small bites, handmade cocktails, and 360 degree views above the park. The thing that I don't get about these places, though, is that they don't have any blenders, so they can't make frozen drinks, which was kind of upsetting to me. I don't know why. Anyway, Helios Grand also has a spacious zero entry pool complete with underwater speakers, poolside cabanas, a hot tub, poolside movies, recreational activities, etc. Now, when it comes to room options, you got a little bit of everything to choose from here. The standard rooms here sleep up to four guests or five if you request a rollaway bed. And these will be your cheapest Helios Grand options with prices ranging around 550 to 650 per night. You've also got your club level rooms, your various suites, your rooms with views across the theme park. But the coolest rooms at Helios Grand are the How to Train Your Dragon kids suites where little ones can take to the skies and rest amongst dragons in a colorful room inspired by the Viking village of Burke. But sleeping amongst dragons will cost you a pretty penny. Don't be surprised if you find this suite well over $2,000 per night. As cool as Helios Grand is, keep in mind that despite the high price you're paying for a room here, you're not going to get the Express Pass perks for Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios like you will when you book a room at the other signature level hotels. And that could be a massive deterrent for you. Certainly is for me since the free express passes really do help rationalize the price of those signature hotels. That being said, Helios Grand still has all the other Universal Hotel perks like early theme park entry on certain days, complimentary shuttle service over to the other parks, and of course that nifty dedicated entrance straight on into Epic Universe. So, we're still going to claim it as today's best Universal Hotel winner for the newness, the fun immersive kids suites, the dining options, and the Epic Universe convenience. But you may still prefer one of the other Universal hotels that are cheaper and/or have more theme park perks for the other Universal parks beyond Epic. Okay, we have made it to the end of our list and there's so much more we want to tell you about your next year's trip to Universal Orlando.

      "transcript": "Today's video is going to be sweet. I'm heading find out which bicky shaped snack reigns supreme. I hope you're hungry and I hope you have a sweet tooth because we're going to eat a lot of sweets today. I hope you brush your teeth. Let's go. All right, we're in Magic Kingdom on Main Street specifically. We are headed to the Main Street Confectionary. We're going to spend a lot of time in here for this video. We're going to get a lot of snacks. This is the confectionary on Main Street. They're going to have anything and every kind of sweet treat you could imagine. So, we are going to head inside and see what Mickeyshaped snacks would find. Now, it is quite early in the morning. That's why this is not um busy at all. But let's see. Oh, this is new to me. Sassy sour pixie dust. That's not Mickeyshaped. I'm getting distracted already. Basically, there's so many sweet treats in here. They've got a bakery. You can even go look at the window and see them making the treats um in front of you. It's really cool in here. Love it. I will say anytime you see any prepackaged snacks, I would encourage you to not buy those if you are wanting to eat this snack on your trip in the park. Uh, but there is a difference. So, like these, for example, you can tell that these were made in-house recently. Um, it even has the date on it, 1027. Um, but then these that are prepackaged, they probably came from somewhere else. These would not recommend. These are going to be not as fresh. They're going to be a little stale. But ones like these are okay. But if you're trying to buy snacks to take home with you, then that's where I would recommend stuff like this. But while you're here in the parks, get the stuff fresh. So, let's take a look through everything they have to offer. They've got everything displayed in the case right here so you can see what it looks like. I see a Mickey cookie. We've got Mickey marshmallow pops. We've got Mickey Rice Krispy treats. A lot of them are Halloween themed cuz that is the season right now. But I'm sure we can find Oh my goodness. Mickey caramel apple. Oh wow. Big old Mickey cookie with Skittles and Twix and M&M's. Oh, and Mickey cupcake. Oh my goodness. This is going to be It's It's 9:30 in the morning. I'm about to get a sugar high. But you know what? I'm going to love it. We got three items from the confectionary. We will be going back there later today, but it is um 9:50 and I didn't want to get 10 snacks from the confectionary at 9:50 in the morning. I would feel a little judged. So, we'll go back later. But, we have three. So, right now we've got the Mickey scone. We've got the Mickey sugar cookie and a Mickey Rice Krispie treat. So, we're sitting at a table kind of on the back side of Casey's corner. Casey's right here next to me, right next to the restrooms, but they're blocked off closed for now, so no one should be over here, which is nice. First things first. Okay, I think the first one I'm going to try right now is a Mickey scone. It feels the most like a breakfast item because it's a scone. So, we have got the Mickey scone. It's got chocolate drizzled on top and little Mickey chocolate pieces. So, this is a very Mickeyshaped item. Let's try. Smells delicious. This is really good. It's It's moist. It's not hard as a rock like sometimes you expect the scone to be. This, I can tell, was made fresh. It's really nice. It's very chocolatey. Would be a fun little breakfast item if you want something sweet. And honestly, would be a pro tip because you get your Joffre at the TTC. You get your coffee there and you grab a little scone from the Main Street Confectionary. No one was in there when I walked in. Like first thing in the morning, people aren't ready for sugary treats yet. So, if you want a sugary breakfast item, you could go grab this instead of trying to conquer the Starbucks line that sometimes, most of the time in the morning's crazy busy. So, I like this. I would recommend this to anyone who wanted a scone sweet breakfast item. I'm going to rate it three and a half out of five. I don't think it's quite four worthy because I don't know. It might be four worthy. No, we're going to stick with three out of five right now. Very solid option, but nothing spectacular. Now, Mickey sugar cookie. This is a Mickey sugar cookie. I bet it's going to be pretty basic. That's a good sugar cookie. It's really thick. Again, tastes nice and fresh. Buy the fresh stuff from the confectionary. Don't buy anything prepackaged, please. Unless you're taking it home. I think that's really good. I think it's a little elevated sugar cookie cuz you've got the icing and the sprinkles on it. Nothing super crazy or standoutish, but if your kid likes a sugar cookie, they're going to be very happy with this. They can pick either pink or blue. Make it pink. Make it blue. You know, I think this is really fun. And it's a thick cookie, too. It's It's not a sugar cookie like the ones that you might get where there's sugar crystals on top. Nothing like that on top. It's just a plain sugar cookie with the icing and the sprinkles. So, the couple bites down here going to have no flavor. It's all up top with the icing. I think right now I like the scone more than I like this. But they're both good. Hold on. The stone is just so much more soft and chewy. I think I'm going to give the sugar cookie a three. Yeah, I think I'm going to give sugar cookie three. Spell 3.5. Now it's time to try the Mickey cereal treat. which this one is going to be a mess. They have different options. It's white chocolate, but it's dyed blue and it's got purple and pink and stars on it. This is for Disney's Starlight nighttime parade. So, love it. Got M&M's. It's got sprinkles. Hey, this is my breakfast. Here we go. This is really fun. I really like this. I like that it's colors for the hurade and the sprinkles. You can see stars. I think that's really fun. These you can get anywhere. You can get so many designs. There are some that will have icing only halfway on it. Uh you can customize your own in other places. I think Disney Springs. Um so these are everywhere. I think they're great. Classic. A classic Mickeyshaped snack. Very sugary. Share this. I could not eat this by myself. I've got a friend with me today running around the parks. I'm going to save all of this. We're gonna eat it all later back at the hotel. So, don't worry. Nothing goes to waste here. It's just so sweet. It's so sweet, but it's so good. I think I'll give it a four cuz I think this one is a lot more iconic, a lot more classic than the other two we've had right now. And I love a rice krispie treat. So this one's going to be a four. Mickey scone 3.5. Mickey sugar cookie three. So far at the confectionary, we've got a lot more to go. Okay, we've got a little bad news. I went over to Westward Hoe in Frontier Land to get the Mickeyshaped pecan bacon cinnamon roll, which I don't I haven't had yet, and I really want to try it because it looks so good. They said they were out. I asked if they were going to have more later. He said maybe 20 minutes, but it's also almost not breakfast time anymore, so I don't know when exactly they switch over the menu, but we'll make it work. We'll figure it out. Don't worry, I will do the hard-hitting science experiments for you by eating all the Mickeyshaped snacks because I care about you and that is how I show that I care. So, now we are going over to Starbucks Circus. They have another basically confectionary back there with Big Top Souvenirs. So, we're going to get a couple more snacks from over there. Maybe I'll get a pretzel before that just to, you know, have a little savory before I eat more sweet again. We'll see. That's a plan. Can't get the cinnamon roll yet. Maybe I'll go back in a little bit. We've made it over to Storybook Circus, which is in the back of Fantasy Land. It is where you're going to find Dumbo. You're going to find some more characters back here. It's really cute. If you've got little kiddos, this is the place to take them to let them run off some steam. And over here we've got Big Top Souvenirs, which is a merchandise location, but it has another big bakery case. It's got lots of treats. Almost like another confectionary. So, we're going to go see what we can find. Smells like candy. Smells like sugar. Okay, we got our stuff from Storybook Treats. I have two tips for you right now. Number one, I am sitting in the tent area in the very very back of Story Lip Circus over by Pete's Silly Sideshow where you can meet the characters. There's a huge tent over here. There there's air ducts right here on the ground blowing out very cold air, which I think is newer. I don't think they've always had that. This has always been a shaded area, but I do think they have recently added these air vents, air conditioners, blowing cold air. So, come over here. They also have a bunch of outlets. to plug in your phones and everything else you need. So, come hang out over here. If you've got a little toddler, they can run around. Give yourself a moment of peace. Tip number two is that places merchandise locations like the confectionary and liked big top souvenirs are technically merchandise locations, not a food location. So, both times when I got stuff from the confectionary and from Big Top, I could use my annual pass discount. So, just a heads up, if you ever need like a water bottle or a Coke, go buy them from like Big Top Souvenirs. You can use your discount. You can't do that at food locations, but you can merchandise locations. So, pro tip. Now, I got to show you what we got. Two things, and they weren't even on my list originally, but I just walked in and I was like, \"Wait, I got to have those. I want to try them.\" So, first up, we got the Mickey Churillo cookie. This is huge. It is literally peekaoo. My face. It's huge. It's got the crystallized sugar on top. It looks delicious. Smells like a churro. I am currently chasing the high of the churo toffee from Disneyland. This will not be that. I know that because it's a cookie and it's not toffee, but some kind of churro flavored dessert, churro themed. I'm chasing that high. So, that's why I got this. Plus, it's huge. Smells delicious. So, let's try it. Okay. Honestly, it's probably the same cookie base of the sugar cookie that we had earlier. The this icing cart is where all the churo flavor comes in plus the sugar crystals on top. I kind of wish there was more than more of it. Like I don't I don't know. That would be a lot of icing. It's like I'm not tasting it enough. Most of it is just the basic cookie without any flavoring. But then you get a bite of it and it's really really tasty. It's not chasing the high of the churro toffee. It's not It's not there. But maybe one day Disney will bring it to Disney World. Disney, please would love that. I don't love this as much as I was wanting to. It's still good. I'm trying to decide if it's equal to, better, or worse than the sugar cookie. I like the little pieces of crystallized sugar. And I do love the icing. I'm not a huge icing person when it comes to cakes and cookies, but this I really like. I wish there was more. I think I'm going to give it a three. Yeah, I'm going to give it a three. Our second treat from Big Top Souvenirs is the Mickey chocolate mint sandwich. Twiffy. Oh, well, that's his backside. this. So, this it's like a Mickey sandwich, but it's not ice cream. It's more It feels like a cookie, but almost a brownie as well. So, we're going to figure it out. But I am a mint chocolate person. Mint chocolate chip is my favorite ice cream flavor. I love mint. I know everybody that's not everybody's cup of tea, but it is mine. So, cheers. So, it's icing in the middle like a sandwich. I know people I'm trying to figure out the line of like mint chocolate versus peppermint. It's not peppermint at all. It tastes like an Andes mint. Expected. It's really, really soft. It's very crumbly. I think the thickness of the cookies is just right with the ratio of cookie to icing. I think they they did that very well. I'm also really liking it because it's so soft and I just ate the cookie that was very hard. I like this better. I know not everybody likes mint. I know. I really like this one. I think I'm going to give it a four. I don't think it's five worthy cuz mint is very divisive. But if you like mint, I would recommend you get this. I'm going to give it a four. All right, as we head to our next location, I'm going to give you a couple more little tips that you might not know about. Number one, there is a walkway between Storybook Circus and Tron. Not very many people know about it. Way less crowded. Are heading to Tomorrowland, so it's easier to go this way than all the way around. Number two, if you are looking for something like a restroom, a water bottle refill station, a fuel rod, charger swap out location, you can search for those in the My Disney Experience app and then click find on map and it will show you all of the places where those things exist on the map. So, I just searched for water bottle refill because there's not I mean there's water fountains everywhere, but the specific water bottle refill stations, there aren't as many throughout the park. So, I searched it, clicked find on map, and the closest one to me was over here at the restrooms at Tron. So, that's where we're headed. And then we'll get our next snack in Tomorrowland, which is perfect. So, if you ever are looking for something specific, search it in the app, click find on map. I do that all the time for so many things. It's very helpful. We've made it to one of Alier's favorite spots. I am at Tomorrowland Terrace in Tomorrowland. It used to be an old quick service and now it's nothing except for when they have firework dessert parties. So if you need a break, if you need plenty of tables and chairs out of the sun, come over here to Tomorrowland Terrace. Nobody's ever over here. I think there's one other family way behind me. But we are trying our first savory item that is Mickeyshaped. Thank goodness we made it to savory. And that is because we are eating a classic Mickey pretzel. This is a basic pretzel shaped like Mickey, but it comes with a huge thing of cheddar cheese sauce. Plastic cheese as some people call it. I'm ready to dig in. Yeah, I needed this. Right now, this pretzel is hitting the spot because it's salty and I've had so many sweet things already. So, I am taking that bias out of my ranking. But this is classic Mickey pretzel. It is just a plain pretzel. Lots of salt. It's not the best pretzel on Disney property by far. There are so many other amazing pretzels. There's even here in Magic Kingdom the cream cheese pretzel which lots of people argue better than a regular Mickey one. But we're not talking about best pretzels today. We are talking about Mickeyshaped snacks. So with that in mind, I do really like this option. I think it's great. Everything tastes better when it's Mickeyshaped. I mean, we all know that it's one of our only savory items on this list, which might give it a little bit of a boost just because of that. But it's a classic snack. You see them everywhere when you go to Disney. You can get them in every park. So, I don't know. I do associate plastic cheese with Disney World. Get this with your pretzels. You can get it over at Casey's Corn dog. Um, you know, with your corn dog nuggets, dip it in the classic cheese. So, I do really love it. I think I'm going to give the Mickey pretzel a 3.5. It's That's a little bit better than halfway. I don't think it deserves a four. No, I changed my mind. I'm bumping it up to a four. If I gave the Rice Krispie treat a four, I think a Mickey pretzel deserves to be four as well. Once again, easily sharable. You can split this between people in your party and it's a good savory bready snack. And I love the plastic sheets. Mayday. Mayday. All right, I got a Mickey ice cream bar. Can't even pull out my DJI camera. I'm using my phone because it's literally it's on my hand. We're making a mess. All right, Mickey ice cream bar. Let me find napkins. I'm going to talk about it in a second, but I ate it. Okay, many things have happened. I now have the Mickey ice cream sandwich. A little less messy. Still messy. Not as bad as the ice cream bar. I'm sitting in the rocking chairs in Liberty Square because they're in the sun right now. I'm at my face, but the rest of my body is in the sun. But let's try this. We'll talk about the two ice creams at the same time. Now, I prefer the sandwich over the ice cream bar. I like the cookies. I like that it is a sandwich. It's easier to eat. It's not as messy. They're both great options. But if I had to pick one over the other, I would pick the sandwich. But they're both getting a five. They're both getting a five. I think you have to get ice cream when you come to Disney World. They're both Mickeyshaped. Very fun. This one has got cookies and cream ice cream in the sandwich, which I also like a little bit better than vanilla. The Mickey ice cream bar is vanilla ice cream with hard chocolate outside. This is a softer sandwich with cookies and cream ice cream. They're both great, solid options. They're both a vibe and I think you have to eat them when you're here at Disney World. Now, with Mickeyshaped ice cream, I also want to shout out the Plaza ice cream parlor over on Main Street. We're not going to get it today, but they do have really good Edies ice cream there. And when you get most of the ice cream options, they will put two little cookies on top of your ice cream to make it kind of Mickeyshaped. It's not completely, but you know, you've got your ice cream with two little cookies on top for Mickey's ears. So, that's another fun option, but just not going to get it today. Another Mickey ice cream option that we're not going to be trying today, but I want to let you know about is the Mickey Brownie sundae over at Hollywood Scoops in Hollywood Studios. That's on Sunset Boulevard. You can get a sundae with a brownie, and the brownie is Mickeyshaped. So, that's another fun option for you if you want a brownie with your sundae. We're heading back down Main Street, back to the confectionary for two more treats. Um, hopefully shift has changed and it's not the same people as this morning. That would be a little embarrassing for me. But regardless, we've got two more things that we need to try and rate and see if they're worth your money. I got the Mickey Marshmallow Pop. This is the classic one. They have a Mickey and Minnie. And I think they had some seasonal ones. Uh, but this is basically just a big marshmallow covered in chocolate with some M&M's. So, what could go wrong? Once again, tastes fresh, tastes homemade, made in house. It's just marshmallow and chocolate. It's very simple, but it's very tasty. This is not something that I'm going to graduate. Graduate. This is not something that I'm going to pick most of the time just because it's a big marshmallow with chocolate. It's good, but I think I'm going to give it a two. I think so far it's going to be our lowest one. It's delicious and I love it. But there are better There are better Mickeyshaped things out there, you know. All right, next up on our list, we have Mickey cookies and cream cupcake. This cupcake has been on quite the journey. I bought him last night at Allstar Movies Resort. I put him in the fridge and now I'm eating him here on the second floor of the Contemporary. So, here he is. Cookies and cream. He's got little sprinkles, couple little ears. That makes him Mickeyshaped. Is this Mickeyshaped? It's technically Mickeyshaped. We're going to eat it first. It's just a little chocolate disc, you know, dark dark chocolate. Yeah, little cupcakes. You can find them all over Disney World. They're not hard to find at all. We normally don't recommend cupcakes because they're not that special, especially when you put all the other fun specialty or seasonal desserts all around Disney World. But oh my gosh, it's huge. But I would not judge you for getting a cupcake either. Okay. I don't I don't think I like the icing. There's probably It's probably the same thing as the gray stuff. I don't think I like it. I don't think I like the consistency of it. It's cookies and cream ice cream. The cake part is just chocolate. The cake part is good, but I don't like icing. I think there are a lot of better options, more unique options, better flavored options all around Disney World. So, I would not encourage you to get any kind of cupcake. But sometimes that's what you like. Do whatever you want to do. But it's not going to be my pick. I'm giving it a one. Mhm. It's a one out of five. Yeah. Can you tell I just ran a half marathon? Cuz I did. I did. So, now I'm going to go to the bathroom and wash my hands. Now, that's not all. We've got some other Mickeyshaped items that I wanted to mention in this video. First and foremost, Mickey waffles. These are a classic, fun Disney snack. Disney breakfast, waffles shaped like Mickey Mouse, sometimes Minnie Mouse. You cannot go wrong. These can be found everywhere. There are so many options. You can find them all over Disney World like resort food courts or table service restaurants for breakfast. But I want to specifically highlight the waffle platter at Fairfax Fair in Hollywood Studios. If you are in Hollywood Studios and need some breakfast for the day, a quick uh walk up quick service option, you can get the waffle platter. It comes with whipped cream, three Mickey waffles, and some fruit. It's a great option. I also want to shout out the chicken filled waffles at Rick's Sports Bar and Grill over at Coronado Springs Resort. These are Mickeyshaped chicken and waffles. Basically, they're stuffed with chicken. Mickey and waffles. Disney's version of chicken and waffles. And they're Mickeyshaped. It's great. Love Mickey waffles. Obviously, five out of five. I'm also going to shout out a classic Mickey caramel apple. Caramel caramel, what do you say? A Mickey caramel apple. Now, these are very cute. They're fun to look at in the bakery case. They're not the most logistically easy to eat. I know it's another classic Mickeyshaped snack, but I don't think it's many people's favorites. I don't know. They're just really hard to eat, but they are so cute. Years ago, cast members would cut the apple for you after you bought them, but they don't do that anymore, sadly. So, I am not going to take the time out of my theme park day to sit and cut up a very hard caramel apple. That's just not I I can't do that. So, if you can, shout out to you. You're better than me. Um, but specifically for caramel apples, I want to shout out the Germany pavilion because those caramel apples wear leader hosen. So, just thought you should know that. Now, one of the most iconic, most well-loved Mickeyshaped snacks in all of Disney World can't be found in the parks, and it's actually over at Porter's French Quarter Resort. And yes, I am talking about Mickey Beignes. These are a five out of five. Honestly, 10 out of five. They are perfect. I have no notes on them. If you have not had a Mickey beignet before, add it to your must do list on your next trip. You have to go get these. They are perfectly fluffy and doughy and so much powdered sugar. They are messy. You've been warned, but they are perfect. And if you've never had one, you absolutely need to get these. And finally, I'm also going to shout out the Mickey pecan praline, which is um over they used to be at French Quarter. Now, you can find them at Riverside sometimes. I you know, they're kind of hard to find and they're not always available. So, just be on the lookout if you like pecan pralines. The Mickeyshaped ones are fantastic. They are fudgel-like pecan filled candy. They're texturally kind of like a cookie, but it's super sweet and super sugary. And these are awesome. But again, they're not always around. So, if you see one on a menu, try it. You'll thank me later. If you're still here, be sure to like the video and put this secret code in the comments so I know that you watched the whole thing. And don't forget to subscribe. We upload challenges, resort reviews, restaurant reviews from Disney World, Universal, and beyond. See you next time."

      "transcript": "Orlando. We made it to Orlando. So excited. I see Manny. I see her, too. First stop on our journey today is at our resort, which is Allstar Music. So, fine. This is But while this is super fun, it is November, so you really have to check the weather for days like this. We've made it to the room. We fought over the bathroom. Everybody did their potty. And now Dean has taken the girls to the playground. So, fun fact, Disney no longer does the complimentary bed rails. Thank you. It's funny how like fast we do stuff, but it's usually like stressful. Yeah. And now it's like, ah, peace. Yep. Thank you. Thank you. Have a candy. Sure. What are you wanting? My coloring in here behind you to make your way to their rowart back. That's a cute snowman. Hey, hello. Bye-bye. something special. Wow. Please don't do a loop. We're not doing that, right? Yeah. You slept good, Lucy. Don't forget just a second there. Let me see. Don't forget your hoodie. Heat. Heat. Everybody Oh, no. You're good. Thank you. Girls got their stuffies. and their ducks. We got our coffee ready for a great time. Thank you. Resorts and other ground transportation options are located on level one. Hello, this is Orlando Mayor Buddy Dire. If you're a resident, welcome home. Please stand clear of doors and hold on the handrail. We made it through Orlando. So excited. So, we are here. That was such a smooth flight. The girls and I napped for most of it, which was fantastic. And I was watching Fantastic 4. Oh, I wonder what you were watching. I glanced over a couple times when I woke up to move my head cuz it hurt. But I got 36 minutes left. It's pretty Oh my goodness. Well, you surely you can finish it on the way back. All right. Well, we're going to go. So, we are getting ready to meet up with our driver and Damon is meeting him upstairs at the carousel and we have popped downstairs to level one where we'll exit to the vehicle to go to the bathroom. So, doing multiple stops at once. Now that we've had our postplane potty break, we are ready to head out with our transportation company. I'm just waiting on it to and our driver our driver to grab the bags upstairs at the carousel here this morning. We are using our favorite MCO to Disney. I will have all their information linked down below um as well as a special discount code that they gave me to share with you guys. We love them and have been using them exclusively for over 2 years now and absolutely love them. All of our drivers are always so sweet and so heard from so many of you guys that also love it. And so yeah, had to always share. They are our favorites. But knowing that these bathrooms are down here, there's nobody ever down here. And there usually there's a men's and a women's on either side of these exits. If not that exit, like the next exit over. So if you're getting ready to get in the car, you can be like, \"Hey, can we take a potty break?\" Right. You girls jump out and go ahead and climb in. Look, look, look out your window. Quick, quick. Look, look, look, look. We're looking. We're looking, baby. We're looking. Did you see him? Snow White, too. You saw Snow White, too? That's so cool. Oh, I see Minnie. You said there's a Donald hiding in the bushes. Yeah, I see Minnie. I see Minnie. I see her, too. Okay, we got Goofy and Dad, look. Is that all star movie? No, that one is sports. This is Yeah, that's cool. First stop on our journey today is at our resort, which is Allstar Music. So, with our transportation company, they offer for $25 extra, you can have a first stop and then a second stop. So, we're stopping here at the resort. Dean is tossing our bags. We have our day bag ready to go for taking with us to Typhoon Lagoon. And that's where we're off to. We're going to head off to the water park and use our free water park entry for today. Are you excited? Yeah. Click the thumbs up button. Click the thumbs up button. Wait. You're such a little YouTuber. And we're going to catch a kitty creek. That's right. We are going to catch a kitty creek. Woohoo. like your nails. You look so good. You like my nails? You catch a kitty kitty? I'm so excited. Wait, are we close to catching kitty? got these. All right. Let me go toss the string real quick. You go that way. I got Lucy. That gives me anxiety. Hi guys. How are you? Hello. Oh my gosh, you're so cute. Whoa, it's Spider-Man. And it's Max's girlfriend and a naked mole rat on the ground. Yeah, she's so excited. This is a new dance. Is that a new dance? I like it. Well, you can probably tell from the music and the atmosphere. We have made it now to Typhoon Lagoon. We are all checked in, ready to go and change into our swim club. The girls are so excited about Ketchuk Creek. It has been a minute since we have been here to Typhoon Lagoon. So, we're going to go check it out. And that is our first stop after we get our swimsuits on. Obviously, we're not swimming in our regular clothes. We're going to go change first. Let's go. Such a cool dad. I have to say winter at the water parks if you can get a nice day is my favorite. Do you see how empty this is? It is fantastic. Fine. This is Bella. Hand that to daddy, please. Thank you. And hand that to daddy. Is mine the one, too? Yeah. You all get them. Okay. So, this is yours. Why do I get shorts? Yours? Cuz you get your shorts with your swimsuit. So, I get to play with the shorts of my No, it's just your cover up, sweetie. I'm so excited for my mom. I can tell you're so excited. I really wanted you to bring this one. So, this is yours. And I don't like Moana in the ship. That sounds like a great idea. You want to go change? Ready? Let's do this. No, you're going to go with mommy. All right. Come on. Go again. Let's do it. All right. Go again. Go again. Whoa. But see what I mean? There is hardly no one here, which is absolutely wild. But while this is super fun, it is November, so you really have to check the weather for days like this. It's a great benefit to get this for free on your check-in day. But who knows? Cuz right now it is currently 76. Today the high is 79. But looking at our weather on Tuesday during our trip, we're here Thursday to Thursday. On Tuesday the high is 58 and the low is 36°. Obviously you're not coming to a water park in that temperature. I don't even know that they'll open the water park with those kinds of temperatures. So obviously that is a TBD kind of moment. But if you can keep a check on the weather, have a swimsuit and in your bag and ready to go cuz it could be a great option. And if you can, there's seriously nobody here, which is amazing. Go Ariel. Go. Heat. Heat. There he is. Heat. Heat. We have now ventured over to Blustery Bay. Lucy saw this and remembered enjoying these water slides when we were here in the past and she's like, I want to go there now. So, we're just kind of boopping around. But this is such a great We're not getting ice cream right now, but it's such a great place here in Bluster Bay. The water is a lot calmer than the main waves over there. And there's two water slides that if you were are if you are under 60 in you can go down. I just barely don't make the cut. The one time I wouldn't mind staying slightly shorter. Did you like the slide? Yeah. And I even want ice cream. What is it going to teach you an ice cream? Eat it. I don't know. I think we need real food first. And we have ice cream. I want ice cream now. Uh, no. Real food now. Hey, I didn't say never. Apparently the words never were heard. I don't I didn't say you run the tape back. I didn't say never. I see a vision with food trays. Lunch is served. Got the chicken bowl. Absolutely love these. It's slightly different than the last time, but it's got corn and peppers and rice and black beans. Yummy chicken. Looks so good. Dean got the barbecue chicken pizza. It has pickled onions and then also pesto sauce. I do like pesto. Looks so good. And then both of the girls got cheese pizza and some French fries. Is that yummy? Yeah, it looks yummy. Nice. We definitely were ready for some food. Breakfast was a long time ago. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Wow. Heat. Heat. Orange. Well, the last 30 minutes has been very eventful. This is our like second take of trying to leave. The girls had their snow cones walking out. We walked up that set of stairs to look. There's like a little observation deck area up there. So, we walked up, looked out that with Lucy and I did coming back down the stairs and I'd literally just be careful walking down the stairs. Puring her snow cone, tumbles down like five stairs, gets all scratched up. We go to first aid, get her all cleaned up, band-aids, all that good stuff. And then they give her a coupon to get another snow cone. So we go get another snow cone. We get back with Dane and Bella with the stroller. She's climbing in. Sits down in the stroller. Second snow cone hits the ground. She's like, \"It's okay, Mommy. We don't have to get another one.\" So that's just Yeah. So real life moments of traveling. I think we're all tired. Yeah. You had a snow cone instead of ice cream. Remember I said you could have ice cream tonight or we could do snow cone. So you like the snow cone? Yeah. But our room is ready. Got a text just before 12:00 um that it was ready. We've been here for about 4 hours. It is um after 2 on 2:30. So, we're going to get out of here, go check out our room, get our bags, get to the room, get our grocery order, kind of get settled in, and we may pop over to Disney Springs for dinner and a little hangout session, but we're ready for our week at Disney. So, we want to be like rested up, so we don't want to do too much today and overdo it. I see a fancy picture. Maybe Heat. Heat. Made it back to Allstar Music. Going to grab our grocery order. It was delivered earlier from Walmart. So, we got that to pick up. Check and see. Sometimes at the values, they'll take your luggage once they know that you have a room. Even without you asking, they'll take your luggage to your room, which is kind of nice. They don't usually do that in other moderate deluxe resorts, so it feels kind of bougie on a budget, so to speak. Um, we're going to see where that's at. Our room is ready. So, yeah. The more we're sitting there on the bus and the sleepier we're getting, the more I think we may be pivot princesses. I fell asleep on the bus. I saw that. It was cute, huh? It was Disney dad in action. That was owl. I think I think we're all getting tired. That 3:30 wakeup call was a while ago. We've made it to the room. We fought over the bathroom. Everybody did their potty and now Dean has taken the girls to the playground so I can do a little unpacking session really quick. I I don't want to do any of this to be perfectly honest. I am exhausted. I don't want to just fall across the bed right now cuz the caffeine's running off and the 3:30 wakeup call are hitting hard. Like we had this whole idea of like going to Disney Springs for dinner and doing all this stuff, but I'm so tired. I'm like I don't I don't I no I think we're going to be pivot princesses and tomorrow we want to rope drop Magic Kingdom and so that's going to require us being up early because early entry starts at 7:30 tomorrow morning. It's a little bit earlier morning for Magic Kingdom, which means we have to get up. We'll like need to leave 45 minutes before and need to get up about 45 minutes to an hour before we want to leave so we can get ready and like this whole thing. So, I'm like already visioning that. So, I think we're going to get to bed. But, right now, we need to unpack and to put some groceries away, organize the room, get us set up and settled in. So, let's do that really quick. Heat. Heat. Are you serious? This is annoying. Usually Walmart is like on top of it when they do their grocery stuff, but literally the best buy date, obviously I understand things are good past the best buy date, but the best buy for this broccoli is the 6th and it is already pretty stinking brown. So the fact that someone picked this up is disappointing. Okay, the carrots on the other hand are good till well after our trip is over. So that's good. Quick grocery rundown. Got some whole shelf stable milk. Got some macaroni cups for little quick meal snacks here at the resort. We can use the microwave that is in the quick service for those. Got a couple boxes of cereal for a little quick easy breakfast. Little bite muffins for the girls. Some bananas. More quick easy breakfast for the girls. They love oatmeal. So going super easy. And then got these as little snacks to put in our park bag. The girls like the regular chomps and we like the jalapeno ones. Those are so good. Little pricey, but they are really, really good. So, that's kind of our grocery rundown. Other than what you saw in the fridge. So, fun fact, Disney no longer does the complimentary bed rails. They now do bumpers. So, let's order some and see what they look like. Good afternoon. Hi, Parker. Um, yes. I was wanting to see could I get two either um bed rails or bumpers or whatever you guys have for little ones um sleeping in beds. Um um I need it for one bed, but I have two kids in it, so I'll need one for each side. So, two total. And then if I could get two extra pillows and two extra blankets. Okay, awesome. Thank you so much. I appreciate that. Thank you. Thanks, Parker. Appreciate it. Thanks. Bye. All right. So, the bumpers, bed rails, whatever they have at the resort right now is on its way. I got two pillows cuz we don't have there's only four. Usually, there's like six in the room. So, I want to make sure we have plenty of pillows cuz I don't want to have to call again. Um cuz it seems like the later in the evening, closer to bedtime, it gets busier housekeeping gets and the longer it can take to get things. And then also, I got two extra blankets because if you have two kids sleeping in a bed, you know the whole like she's hogging the blanket, she's stealing the blanket. And from a lot of you that I've chatted with, it doesn't get better as they get older. It's like they can be so sweet and so kind and so sharing and just like oh my gosh we are like doing such a great job as parents and then the next thing you know they're like nipping at each other. It's just the eb and flow of multiple kids. So if you know you know but we're going to keep unpacking get a little bit more done. I also need to kind of officially set up the stroller for Disney. So let's let's do some more things. Yes. All right. So, I showed this in it was actually a collaboration video that I did with Bags Smart, which if you know, you know, I love Bags Smart stuff. Like, they've got some really great products. But unsponsored review afterwards, I still love it as much as the sponsored video. This is amazing. I'm literally just going to open this suitcase. This was an extra outfit I tossed in. And then I tossed in a couple of extra pairs of shorts for Dean here. So, these are a little wonky up at the top, but I'm just literally going to uncip this. And this is a stack of clothes for the first section of the trip. And then we get into a stack of clothes for the second section of the trip. And it's almost like my hanging packing cubes that I love so much. But it's just this little door. And then I've got extra swimsuits here in this top. Extra shorts. And then the girls and eyes pajamas are in this top zipper section here, which is awesome. So, if you're looking for a bag with a ton of organization, it is wild. It also has a built-in scale, which I thought was so stinking cool. So, really like that. Throw my extra shoes under here. But anytime you can have a really cool suitcase and it doubles as organization, I am all about it. So that was kind of how I packed. We have suffic to say suffice it to say we've had a lot going on behind the scenes. Um just been Yeah. Yeah. But we've had a lot going on. So I didn't get to film an official pack with me. I did like stages of stuff and I had this like whole thing planned but we just just ran out of time. Sometimes life gets in the way and I hate it because it's like man I was really excited about the content I had planned but it is what it is. We're good. We're moving on. We're at Disney now. We're surviving. It's fun. We're having a good time and got one more bag to unpack and then I'm going to have this just done which I love. I also love the fact that when you organize as you're packing, it makes this whole process so much easier because past you has done future you a favor. You're right now unpacking and setting up or at least even if you don't want to unpack fully, just kind of getting things ready for the week is doing future you a favor. Cuz listen, when the alarm goes off in the morning for 5:30 me to get ready to go to Magic Kingdom, I'm not going to want to do all this stuff either. So today, me is sucking it up and we're like, we're going to get it done. So that way I can go into tomorrow and have a park day that's just like, woo, we're ready. Let's do this. All right. So, we have the park bag ready to go for tomorrow. The umbrella that needs to go in the stroller. The girls undergarments, shorts for under clothes, all that good stuff's in here. our tote bag for our extra goodies for the stroller. This is usually our weather gear bag. And voila, the bottom is empty now. And the top we have headbands cuz you know got to be cute and all. It's a Christmas trip. Let's see. I got the girls little flats here. Those are the same size. Those are the same size. The popcorn bucket. This is probably one of the most rule baker rule breaker controversial things that I do cuz I am so type A. I'm like the oldest. So I have the whole like I am a rule follower. Like rules are meant to be followed. But everybody else brings their popcorn bucket back trip after trip. They've got the passholder bucket that you can use. I see all these old popcorn buckets from literally like 10 years ago and they're still bringing them and people are still getting them refilled. So, she's back. I don't know. That's that that's my controversial thing that I do at Disney. That's this. If I ever get in trouble for anything at Disney, it'll be this backup lollies hydration popcorn lid that I just threw off dramatically. Toiletries and mama's bag of fun tricks. I want to kiss you before. All right. In mama's bag of tricks, we have an inflatable bumper that I always bring, which now that Disney's doing bumpers, I may not need to pack this, but I packed it cuz we're still TBD on the whole bumper situation. the inflator for said bumper, which don't worry, I'll show you what we are using it for in just a minute. So, hold that thought. Got our handy dandy laundry detergent sheets. These are fantastic. Miss Mouse kills it. Like, they are so good. And then our little popup laundry hamper cuz I'm a weirdo and I like to go home and clean clothes. You know, laundry is just more magical at Disney. Also, this camera angle is just like so profession. Christmas lights because it's Christmas. Extra activities for the girls. They're little ornaments for them to put together. Window clings. Decorations for the window. Listen, it's Christmas, okay? We're going all out. garland also for the window, an extension cord for the Christmas lights, and suction hooks cuz you can't use command hooks at a Disney resort, but we still want to decorate. Oh, and tape. And then we'll get into this in a second. for you. I want this for you. I want this. Hi there. Oh, no. Uh, you can just set it on the table. Thank you so much. I appreciate that. I'm going to put the blanket. Oh, okay. Okay. Actually, I'm going to make the blanket. Okay. Thank you. Okay. These little decorations are so cute. They're actually magnets. They're like honeycomb design and they just stick together and they make these little Christmas trees. So, I'm just going to set them in the window. Usually I was thinking the window seals were a little wider, but they're not. So, it's okay. Yeah, this one's not going to fit. But we'll decorate the room with this one. It can go on the like dresser or something. But these little guys will work. I know. I'm way too excited about this. These are so cute. Look at them. the room is set up with the exception of the girls bed. The bumpers are TBD. They brought the pillows, brought the blankets, and I was able to request a microwave. Sometime housekeeping has those, sometimes they don't. So, your mileage may vary. But if you have food, you're trying to feed your kids, doing those types of things, having budget friendly meals, have needed for a baby or anything like that, special dietary restrictions, whatever, you can ask for them. Anyone can ask for them. So, just sharing. A lot of times our luck has not been so great with getting them. But today, we got lucky and we got one. So, you really never know. Um, but that definitely makes it easier. So, in the morning when we're trying to get ready and the kids want some oatmeal, we don't have to trek all the way to the quick service to heat it up. Makes it really convenient. So, you know, there you go. You can ask for those. Just a heads up. Um, but I think the room is basically ready. We're decorated. Got a little tree there. I have the other red tree in the bathroom. Let me show you the window and then we're going to go meet up with Dina and the girls cuz it's 4:19. I'm getting hungry and I want to get back so we can like start getting ready for bed. Mama's tired. Heat. Hey. Hey. Hey. Oh, did you think there was a swing here? I'm sorry, baby. There's not a swing here. But there's slides. Good job, Belle. You going to go? Yep. Can you catch me? Right here. Can you hear me? Hey. Yeah. I don't think it's working. All right. You try. All right, Lucy, talk into it. Good job. I'm letting the girls guide us back to the room. So far, we've taken only wrong turns, so we'll see if we make it back. We actually just got to go like straight over there, but they don't know that. Lucy said she knows which way to go. Lead us. Oh, fearless leader. Who's that? Which way? To the left. Wa! That girl has that girl from the hotel has those things. That girl. Wait, who's I think that's decorating. You think it's me? Wo, that is awesome. You like it? Yeah, I like the snowflakes, too. Oh, thank you. And the giant giant Mickey I went out to meet Dean and the girls, but they were already coming back in. So, we're settled in. Got one kid in the shower, one kid is playing with their coloring book. Dean is getting our pizza. We are just going to have a pizza party in the room tonight. So, we are going like fullon relaxation, just chill, just kind of easing easing into our Disney trip, laying out everybody's clothes for tomorrow. that way can just kind of mindlessly get dressed. All the all those little prep things that you can do like stepping ahead. I'm all for it. But I also did want to mention that the bumpers have arrived. So I wanted to kind of share those. We'll set up the bed after we eat kind of having our pizza our little pizza party. But these are exactly what we used on Bella's bed when she needed them at home. She doesn't usually I don't know. we've taken them off the bed at home, but as soon as I don't use them at Disney for whatever reason, they fall out of bed here. Like, they don't fall out of bed at home, but they do here. And I'm like, I just I don't know, don't want to deal with that on vacation. So, Disney has gotten rid of their bed rails, the little standup ones that if you've seen any of our other room setups and things like that that we've done coming to Disney over the years, those are not really a thing. They're phasing them out and they are replacing them with these. So, these are actually going to just slide under the mattress pad um sheet of the bed. Also, it's exactly the same as the inflatable bumper that I usually bring. Um they're still in kind of a transitional phase, so some resorts may still have bed rails for a little bit and then some of them have gone strictly to bumpers. But if this gets to be a consistent thing to where they have these, I may or may not need to pack those unless I just want them as like a backup. They don't take a lot of space, which is great. So, it's not hard to pack them, but I will usually have one of these that I will stick in the center, and that's what I brought the inflatable one for when they were the bed rails. So, some of you are probably like, why are we doing a a talk about this? But those of you that need like sleep help, like you you get this. this is for you. Um, we fold down the bed, put the inflatable one in the center to divide the bed into two spaces, and that way we have zones. Everybody stays in their zone. Makes it a little bit easier to follow rules when we've got boundary lines here. And then we've got the bumpers now on the edge of the bed so nobody falls out. But wanted to share that for anybody that's like, we got multiple kids. They're not in pack and plays anymore. Like we've kind of graduated past that. We even graduated past the slumber pods and the bump and the um inflatable mattresses, which I kind of miss those. Not even going to lie. I kind of miss those. But you know what? We're at where we're at and we're celebrating the phase that we're in. But also, one thing that not all of the Disney cast members are trained on, and some of them may not be parents, and so they don't understand that one is kind of a replacement for the other is some people have called and asked for bed rails, and they've been like, \"We don't have any.\" They come to find out like last day of their trip, they're like, \"Oh, we do have bumpers though. Do you need bumpers?\" And it's like, \"Yes, I needed those on Monday. It's Saturday. I leave tomorrow.\" Like, that would have been helpful to know. So, all that to say, knowing what to ask for is also very important knowledge. So, if you're here and you're coming, definitely ask for bed rails or bumpers. So I for the next couple months I would just do that automatically because that's how I phrased it and they were like we don't have the bed rails anymore but we do have the bumpers. So depending on what category they have. So knowledge is power. So I'm equipping you that way you can help with sleep cuz kids sleep is hard. Okay? It is stressful. There is a lot to it and especially on vacation we want to sleep good. Everybody's not in their normal routine in their normal habitat. This is a little different. So, we're all about making sleep as best as it can be because the better sleep you get, the better day you're going to have. The better day you have, the more magical your trip's going to be. wanted to show a little bit of how we set up the bed. So, with these bumpers that Disney offers, we're just again sliding them under the fitted sheet mattress protector situation going on there. Just being able to pop them under. They're honestly to me a little bit easier than the bed rails were, especially if the side of the bed frame itself has strange edges. And then I'm just going inflating that center and bumper that I bring to kind of divide it into the two zones like we talked about. But once I get that done, I'll slide it into the middle of the bed. and we are all set and ready to get some sleep and ready for our week at Disney. Thank you guys so much for coming along for our travel day. I'm so excited to share the rest of the vlogs from our Christmas Disney trip with you guys. We have a Disney Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom Day coming as well as a full day at Epcot. So, super super excited and can't wait to share the rest of our adventure with you guys. But thank you for watching. Thank you for being here. If you haven't already, don't forget to click that thumbs up button. And I appreciate you guys. And end of the video club. You got to leave me some Christmas emojis. That way I know you're here and part of the special club. But we'll see you guys right back here in the next one. Bye."

      "transcript": "Merry Christmas. It's Christmas at Universal Orlando. We are going to be seeing a lot of fun Christmas things today. I have arrived with the only goal of absorbing as much Universal Christmas as possible. You are coming with me and we are going to have so much fun. And if you have a Santa hat, put it on. Um, and hopefully you're in the AC and not in 85° Florida like I am. Universal holidays last from a little bit before Thanksgiving this year, November 21st, all the way into the very first days of January. And I am starting my exploration of Universal Holiday this year with what might be just the best holiday tip there is at Universal. Um, and also the scariest. I will not elaborate. We are starting the day today with something I've never done before. We're going to the most famous part of Universal Holiday, which is Grinch Miss at Seuss Landing. Huge Grinch Christmas makeover. Um, all over Seuss Landing. There are who's running around. Oh, I can see some place right now. And you can even meet the Grinch, which we'll talk about. It's tricky. Um, but I am sort of using a little cheat code here for a Grinchmith where I am going to the Grinch and Friends character breakfast. Uh, this is available for most of the Universal Holidays dates. And it is $58.99 for adults and $32.99 for kids. Uh, it's a character breakfast where you get an appetizer, an entree, and a beverage. And then you also get to dine with the Who's and have a special meet and greet at the end with the Grinch where you don't have to uh wait quite as long to meet him. Is that Martha May Huvier? Oh my gosh, she's fabulous. Oh, she's fabulous. I'm very excited to try this because it isn't all that much pricier than your typical theme park table service. And uh it is really helpful with meeting the Grinch, which can be quite the time suck later in the day. So, uh, hopefully it's good. The breakfast is at Circus Mcgherkus Cafe Stupendis in Seuss Landing. Uh, it's closed to be this breakfast for the beginning of the day. And you can find like sandwich boards pointing you over towards checkin. Check out the umbrella and they'll take you inside to meet some who's meet some who beast. Hello. Yes, my friends live in there. They're who sized. What is that? I didn't know that you could have a mirror this small. Yeah, very small mirror. Oh, I'm so sorry. You look fabulous. Oh, so yeah. So, I know it's No, it's incredible. I'm so used to it. That was so fun. I was a little nervous because uh character breakfast alone are daunting um because you've got to interact with the characters, but they're they spend a lot of time with you and actually have like conversations and then the Grinch isn't as stressful because the Grinch isn't in here, which I was scared I was going to be like eating and the Grinch was going to come like taunt me. You actually get a little ticket. It's this that you take to go see the Grinch after you eat. So, you grab your ticket, you go outside, and you go see the Grinch after in a much shorter line than everybody outside is waiting in the regular park to see the Grinch. So, um that makes it super easy. You get a full Grinch meet and greet in addition to this character breakfast, the Who's And the Who's are going wild. They're Oh my gosh, the Grinch isn't here. I'm so afraid. Okay, I think that's just where you meet him. Everyone calm down. I was about to get so scared that he was going to come over here. I fear him in a loving way. But yeah, so there's lots of different who's walking around and the who's keep like getting up in the ceiling and like making everybody sing Hoola songs um and just coming and hanging out. She like came and sat at my table and hung out with me. Um it's great so far. Like I mean literally already so much fun with the characters. So also the way breakfast works is it is this menu and you have who nibbles which are the cinnah who welcome wheel um which you can get all of this is included in the one price for the breakfast. Um so you can get the cinnoo welcome wheels and then you can select one entree and they will let you select from the kids menu if you're a grown-up. So that's cool. Um so you can select one entree from the menu. Um, and then it does come with juice, coffee, soft drinks, and one specialty non-alcoholic drink, the Grinch with Sour Apple. Please join me. Amazing. My friends are in here. They're like, they're littleer than whose size. Fancy thing technology. Oh, wow. My hair likes I just woke up. Oh, really? Yes. It's the 25th annualation. I've been running around. Oh my gosh. Helping Dora decorate everything. It's been quite a feat. Absolutely. I mean, it's a lot of decorations. Yes. Have you met my friend, Mr. Grinch? Not yet. I think I'm going to go after I eat. Can I tell you a secret? Yes, please do. You guys can know this, too. Yeah. Everybody keep it secret, though. He loves warm hugs. Warm hugs. Oh, man. Oh, Sydney loo. Um, you know, you can tell because her who knows hasn't grown in yet. Um, but we are going to do what she said and give the Grinch a warm hug. And that will be good for both him and I. Um, so I did get our appetizer which is the craziest appetizer I've ever seen. Now granted this you get one for the I think you get one for the table and I am alone at my table which means I got one for just me. So this is the cinnahoo welcome wheel. So we're going to try it out. It looks like an incredible cinnamon roll. It is an incredible cinnamon wheel. Ah, that's so good. Extra large cinnamon cream and cheese frosting. Very cream cheesy. It's got that nice tang that sort of helps with the sweetness, but still like super super sweet. Fresh fruit on the side, which I love fresh fruit, especially breakfast time. So, I was really happy to see a whole plate of berries. Um, and then with crumble on this is biscoff. They're kind of going crazy in here. Oh, I got this. This is the specialty drink. It is included. non-alcoholic Grinch miss sour apple sour apple icy with whipped sweet cream foam and red sprinkles. And it comes in this adorable Grinch and Friends breakfast cup. It's very cute. Very Christmy. I'm feeling quite Christmy in here. Sorry, Grinchy. I'm feeling quite Grinchy in here. I'm trying it. I'm scared cuz it's sour apple. This is good actually. So, one thing is that it's not You don't have like frozen slushes here. have legitimate ices at Universal, which is a big help here. Is that I It's like a movie theater icy. And it's not sour enough to make you pucker, but it does still taste like green apple. And then the sweet foam is really nice. A little too thick to like easily drink the sweet foam. Got to get kind of creative. And honestly, I'm probably going to stir mine in, which is going to turn this maybe into a sludge. This is like the frozen butterbeer method. It's definitely like very, very sugary for breakfast. This is a treat. Um, but your kid will love this. And it's included, so why not, you know? And it's Grinch Mist. And the Who's run on sugar and so do you apparently? And so do I apparently because they don't have decaf, which isn't caffeinated anyway. I actually do have friends with me there and there. Hi friends. They're very small. How do they How do they fit in there? They're really, really small. We'll get you out. Yeah, I'll get you out. I promise. We are on a snowflake. They're on like speck of dust. Even smaller. Very little. Wow. Interesting. Well, the name's Anyhoo. Nice to meet you. I'm Quincy. Anyhow, nice to meet you, Quincy. Famous Hollywood actor here. Really? Back in town after a long time away. Okay. Okay. I'm researching a role. Okay. What role? Can't tell you. I signed an NDA. I see. Don't ask me to spell NDA cuz I don't know how to. I'm going to be honest. I was not expecting breakfast to be good. I figured it would be kind of like hokey. It's in Circus Pirkus Cafe Supendis, which has fine food, but it's a quick service. So, I guess just in my head, wow, breakfast is good. So, this is the Mount Crumpet French toast. It is pyifi pistachio cream cheese stuffed to bio French toast. That's why. Dark chocolate ganache, toasted pistachios, and fresh strawberries. I saw pistachio cream cheese, but I didn't read the word stuffed, so I was expecting it to be on top. It is stuffed with this incredible pistachio cream cheese. It reminds me of like Fran Japan, but with pistachio instead of almond. Honestly, this by itself would be a draw to this breakfast for me. It's like crispy and fried and like breaded, like crumbly breaded with breaded bread. You get it. And it has more strawberries. I would I mean truly they're doing something with this and everything else I've seen in the chilies and stuff look great. The train comes through here and then everybody waves the Highway in the Sky trolley tree. [Applause] [Music] I don't want to be crazy. I think this is the best French toast I've ever had. Now key to note is I am a huge pistachio fan, but This is really, really good. There are Who's everywhere, man. And now it's embarrassing for the best French toast I've ever had to be at the Grinch and Friends holiday breakfast. But the Who's No Sugar, so maybe it's not our final little inclus. I wanted to show you the kids menu. It's a coloring page and they saw me looking at it and they let me have it. Um, and it has a little crossword and like it's a full activity kids menu. You don't actually see this a ton in theme park restaurants. So, I love this. Um, and then you got your Grinch cookie. Now, this is crazy because this is a cookie that you can actually buy out in the land. We'll go look at how much it is because the more I'm sitting here, the more I'm like, I think the price on this is like insanely worth it. We'll go find out more. But this is a Grinch cookie that you can literally buy outside. The exact same one. Um, and it's all packaged up. So, even though you're super full from your breakfast, you had a ton of sugar. Maybe if you're me, you can pop it in your bag and have it for later or take it home as a souvenir. Um, which is great. And this is how you know it's a Grinch movie. It's got the little heart on it. I'm having really I'm having a lot of fun. Okay, before I go meet the Grinch, I just want to like run over my overall thoughts here. Um, they've done a really great job with this experience. It's such a fun environment because it's obviously the Dr. Seuss restaurant, so it fits. There's everywhere. I spoke to five different who's and I saw I think at least two more walking around. There's tons of who's um there's cloth napkins and like it's a it's a real more like restauranty experience. Um but it's all like paid for in advance so you don't have to think about like oh do I want to get the really expensive thing. It's all the same. It's all included in the price of the experience and then you can kind of just get whatever you want. Shocked by the quality of the food. Absolutely shocked. I even like the icy. um really truly like was not expecting that. Um I would like consider returning to this breakfast for this French toast. I'm not even a sweet breakfast person. Um yeah, the who spent so much time with you. It is so much fun. And then hopefully a short wait to meet the Grinch. So let's go see that guy. What you doing over there? Hey little bit of an uncomfortable moment here. So here's your situation, right? It's breakfast. Yes. They didn't invite me for the menu testing process. So, all of the food is a little lacking of seasoning. I see. I see. So, I'm helping them out by seasoning the food. See? See the roast beef here? The turkey? Yes. This is my good stuff. Oh, you know what? I was thinking that there was a little something extra to the taste of my breakfast. What' you get? I got the French toast. The French toast. You know how they crack the eggs? How? I know how they crack eggs. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. Yes. I knew too. Mine are scrambled. I know. Show you take the French toast. You do the eggs and milk the butter. My secret chos. Just a little. Just I got to say I question it, but it was delicious. It's a work of art. It's a work of art. It's a work of art. It really is. I I do think we might have a I think we might have a problem now. What's your problem? Tell me. One of us is going to have to change. It's got to be you. Yours is fake. Mine's a real deal. And you got the matching. Hey, I stole all of Christmas and the only thing I didn't give back was Santa's outfit. It fits me better and it's a little loose. That guy's fat. That's Yeah, he's a big guy, but it's okay. Me, too. Yeah. I mean, these are my three best friends. One, two, three. Well, my dear friend, shall we show off our best friends together? I think so. Let's do it. Let's show off your best friend. Well, I guess we'll see if we make it through the day. Also, I think that was probably a horrible picture of me and the Grinch, but really, is it a good picture with the Grinch if it's a good picture with the Grinch? No. It would be a bad picture of the Grinch if it was flattering for either of us. Um, so I got really like the best possible picture of the Grinch. I'm gonna say it was like 13 12 to 14 minutes waiting to meet the Grinch. Now, you keep that in mind, okay? Because we're going to go look at how long folks are waiting to meet the Grinch physically right now. Now, I don't know that meeting the Grinch outside of the breakfast is worth it. Don't panic. Meeting the Grinch is worth it. It is one of the coolest meet and greets of all time. It is just like meeting the live action movie character. So fun, so funny, not scary at all for the kiddos. Um, just a really, really cool meet and greet experience. I personally have never done the meet and greet uh for fun and I don't recommend you do either for one very good reason and that is because the line is unbelievably insane. Um, the best way to meet him if you want to not pay for the breakfast is to arrive early early early. You'll need early entry and to go ahead and line up for the Grinch as soon as you can. And then you might end up once the park opens being one of the first people in. But then you're still waiting a ton of time. It's just before the park opens. But I'll show you right now. This is the line for the Grinch. And you're like, \"Oh, that's not bad. I'll just hop in line.\" The Grinch spends a lot of time with folks. He makes sure it's a special memory, which is great. It makes the wait worth it for some people. But this is the wait time right now of 120 minutes to meet the Grinch. It was 2 hours of your park day meeting the Grinch. It's just not something that I think is very easy to stomach when you've spent so much on a park ticket. Um, then again, it's also not easy to stomach an expensive breakfast. But let's break down how worth it that breakfast was price-wise. So, you would skip a 120 minute line. It's kind of like having an express pass to meet the Grinch. Uh, which we're not going to price, but just think about what that would be worth to you. Like maybe $5, $10. It can be little. Um, you also get breakfast. Breakfast included an appetizer that I would say would be probably $10. Uh, if you got it on its own, it included an entree that I would say would probably be around $18ish if you got it on its own. It included a specialy drink. That would probably be I'm next to a place that specialally drinks. $7. Um, if you got it on its own and then you got that free cookie, which you can buy right here. You can literally see Grinch cookies are 5.29. Okay, so altogether if you did that breakfast food-wise, not even counting characters, not even counting the Grinch meet and greet, then you would be spending like 40ish bucks. And that was for just me. Obviously, a shared appetizer wouldn't necessarily be 40-ish bucks a person, but for an adult, you're looking at like 30ish plus dollars per person. And for the kids, those still aren't going to be cheap kids meals. I would say you're looking at like maybe 17ish for a kid. So for me, I would expect to pay around 40 bucks for that at a regular restaurant. Um it's a character meal where I met a gajillion bajillion who's they just kept coming. Um character meals usually at a premium. Uh Universal does not have a ton of character meals. I don't even know if there are any besides this one actually. I'm pretty sure no. So, this is the only character meal that Universal has, but at Disney character meals are a hefty premium. And on top of that, the food was really good and the experience was really fun and the who's were great to interact with. I would do that again in a heartbeat on my own dime anytime um if I wanted to meet the Grinch instead of waiting an hour, two hours, 3 hours for the meet and greet with the Grinch. Particularly because they've done such a great job where you actually get to have a full one-on-one meet and greet experience, not at your table with the Grinch. I just I think it was a wonderful experience. I literally heard people speaking to the managers when I was on my way out talking about how great of a job they've done with that. So, I can 100% back that. That was so much fun. Now, Grinchfist is not just in that character breakfast and Grinch meet and greet, though. Uh it's one of my favorite parts of Universal Holidays. You can see there's decorations all throughout Seuss Landing. Uh garland and wreaths and of course all the decorations are just as silly as the Dr. Seuss designs. Um, it literally it's amazing. It looks like Christmas threw up in here. It's great. Sorry, Grinchness. Um, they even have garland on the cake, on the fish on the Cat in the Hat ride. It just looks awesome. Um, and while the only way to meet the Grinch is to wait in a super super long line or do the Grinch breakfast. Um, and there's one other way, which is another splurge, but could be a great way to get through it. Uh there is also you can meet the who's out and about in Whoville as well a little later in the day. Now I always really want to meet the Who's they are so fun to interact with and you'll see them wandering throughout uh Seuss Landing a little later in the day. They are so fun to interact with but a lot of people want to talk to them. A lot of people want to take videos of the who's and they end up sort of like all crowding around them. um you'll have a shorter experience with them. Whereas I literally got I mean probably cumulative like 15 minutes maybe 20 minutes speaking to who's in there. Like I talked to a lot of who's had a lot of fun with them. Um so another plus on that breakfast. I really am impressed with it. Um and they have times all morning but uh we I think are going to head into the Grinch Miss Hool Spectacular. This is a massive stage show that tells the story of the Grinch. live performers, live singing. Uh the Grinch is there. There Max is there. Yes. Is of course a real dog and it's here. Now, this show does fill up. It's a huge theater and it still fills up because it is so popular, so Christmassy, so nostalgic. I think it's easy to forget how nostalgic Dr. Seuss is for a lot of us. But when you hear some of those Grinch lines when I heard about the Grinch's heart growing three sizes from Cindy Lou, uh that was surprising. I just realized I forgot to hug the Grinch. I got nervous. Okay, he was talking about flatulence. You know, it was tough. There are shows all day. You want to arrive probably 20 to 30 minutes in advance of these shows or else you run the risk of the theater getting full. Um, and you definitely want to see this. It is a must do show. I truly deeply love the holidays at Universal. I'm so glad we're hanging out here today. It's such a well done seasonal event and it's not an upcharge. You get everything. All the holiday offerings are available to you with the price of your park ticket. And there's holiday offerings at the resorts and citywalk, too. There's so much so much to see, so much fun to have. Um I I love any honestly, to be honest, any Universal seasonal event. Marty got Halloween Horror Nights and Universal Holidays. Absolutely incredible events. Um and all the Halloween Hornets included in the price of your park ticket. We've got so many fun things to see today. Another [Music] reason to get to that show early is because a lot of the the queue outside is in the direct sun and if you're there like 30 minutes early, you'll be in the final part which is fully shaded which was very good for me cuz I don't do well with the sun. But oh gosh, it's such a wonderful show. The Grinch is so cool cuz it's just like it just feels like a Christmas classic. Um even though it's like relatively new as history goes. That show is really really wonderful. There's a couple of musical members of course who sings Where Are You Christmas? Martha May has this incredible song. Um and they do You're a mean one Mr. Grinch with a narrator singing and she was so good. It's an incredible singer. and she and the Grinch had some really fun like little jokes together. Some more modern ones. Uh, apparently the Grinch is cooler than me because he said 67. I still don't get that one. I know if you're watching as parents, you're with me and maybe your kids say it. What are the What does it mean? And when you ask them what it means, they're like, it doesn't mean anything. Then why are we saying it? I just don't get it. But the Grinch says it. But basically, I'm having a killer Grinch this morning. Um, cuz we know done all the Grinch. And look, this is the line for the next show backed all the way back up here. Um, and they are probably very close to closing it off. Um, despite the fact that I don't think the show's for another like 15, 20 minutes. So, get here early if you want to see it. And it's a long show. It was about It's about a 45minute show, which is long for a theme park show, but it's a specialty like one time a year show. It's really great. There's a live dog. I know I mentioned that already, but it just feels important. Um, it really does just make you smile. Snow's in the theater. Kids love it. I just love it. They also did really cool this year. They did a whole Spanish bit during the show where like the Grinch and the narrator were doing like little like jokes in Spanish and I heard a lot of people in the audience feeling like very excited about that. So, it was really cool. Um, yeah. Seriously love that show. It's a must do. It's not Christmas at Universal unless you see the Grinchmiss holiday spooktac what Hoola day. I keep just wanting to add ooh everywhere. The Grinch miss Hoola day spectacular. But I think we can bid a Grinch miss to see you later because I would like to go check out some Christmas in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Those are the two lands here in Islands of Adventure, which is the first park we're checking out today. Uh those are the two lands that do a ton of Christmas. Harry Potter World Hogsme and uh I keep want to call it Grinch Land, Seuss Landing. They do tons of Christmas. So that's usually where I like spend a lot of my Christmas time here at Islands of Adventure. But there's really cool Christmas stuff over at Universal Studios 2. So we're going to make sure that we hit both. Um and maybe even a little something in Citywalk that you don't even need a park ticket for. I don't know. We'll see how it p pans out. We have a pretty major finale in both parks to get to. So, um, we're just gonna have to see how time runs. Happy Christmas, Harry. It's Christmas in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter Hogsme. I love Christmas in the Wizarding World. They do such incredible decorations. Um, and yes, Christmas is in all three Wizarding Worlds now, as is in this park. It's over in Dagon Alley, which we'll see today, and then we won't see today, but I have a couple of clips. Christmas has hit plus cache the rising rules of Harry Potter Ministry of Magic over at Epic Universe as well and it is beautiful. So here in Hogsme uh it's kind of like a more rustic garland vibe. It's very very cool in Plas Cashache. The lore is that all of the shopkeepers have decorated their own shops which is why it's a little mismatched. You'll notice that the decorations all kind of go with the the store that they're on. It's very cute um and just feels magical. I think that any of the wizarding worlds already feel so magical and then Christmas inherently magical. So, when you pair those together makes for a pretty fun time. Now, I do think I hear something. Um I think I'm I think I'm hearing I think I'm detecting a bit of Christmas cheer. Yes. Yes, I think I am. And I think we should seek it out cuz I think there's Christmas cheer happening up ahead. The Frog Choir is out. The Frog Choir is of course Hogwarts's student choir and they sing typically wizarding songs. Uh, but at Christmas they sing wizarding Christmas songs, some of which you might recognize. And it's pretty awesome. So, let's go uh catch the Christmas Frog Choir. We wish you a merry Christmas. We wish you a merry Christmas. We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year. Frog is awesome. They do sing a capella with the help of their toads. Frogs. I guess it's frogs. They're really big frogs. Wizard frogs. Anyway, they sing a capella and they're really good. Sometimes there's a beatboxer. I love when there's a beatboxer and today the beatboxer was also like a bass singer, but like a deep deep bass singer. It was awesome. Um, hot take. I actually like the Christmas show a little bit better than the normal one. So, it's a must do for me is to hear I mean there's something about like ac cappella in general, you know, can come and go. acappella Christmas songs kind of hit and yeah, just awesome. So much fun. Um and they have like cute little character moments. Very cute. And you can take pictures with them. I just love the Frog Fire. Um that is the only Christmas show over here. The regular tri- wizard show um doesn't really have much of a Christmas overlay. It's kind of the same, but the uh the big finale is also over here. Uh Hogwarts Always. So that will be for later. That'll be for tonight. Still want to get a little a little something for the train. So, um, personally, I'm going to get a fun wizarding sip, hop on the Hogwarts Express to head over to Christmas and Diagon Alley. Hopped by the Hogs Head. They don't have any Christmas specialty beers or anything. That would be really cool. They do for Halloween Horror Nights usually have specialty beers, but they do have beers you can't get anywhere else at Hogstead. So, it's hard for me to pass up um their like special wizarding ales because they're some of my favorites and I can't get them anywhere else. All right, we are headed on the Hogwarts Express at this time. You can bring a beverage on the Hogwarts Express. Uh, it was a 10-minute wait when I walked by earlier. It's a 25 minute now. Hopefully, it's kind of in the middle of those two things. Um, but this is a great way to get between the two parks if you want to have a little fun while doing it. Otherwise, it's a really long walk. You do have to have a ticket that gets you into both Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure to be able to ride the Hogwarts Express at all. Uh, they do scan your park ticket before you go and get in line, which is right up here. And then you get to ride the Hogwarts Express. It's a different experience depending on which direction you ride it because looking out the window, you're going to see some wizarding stuff. Um, and of course, it's just really cool to get to ride it in general. But I'm gonna pop across to Universal Studios and get to see a little bit of uh Christmas and Dagon Alley. I waited about dead on 20 minutes for Hogwarts Express. And I took the Hogwarts Express. I came over here to Universal Studios. I went to the bathroom, which I usually wouldn't tell you about except for the fact that it smelled like straight Christmas in there. So like fine. like they're using like Christmas tree smell. I don't know if they always do and maybe they just cleaned and I just have never noticed before, but it was also Christmas music. I don't know. Great bathroom trip to fit fit into the scope of the video. We're now in London, which you can see is decorated for Christmas. We are This is part of the wizarding world is London out here. But obviously for us to really get a sense of wizarding Christmas, we've got to head into Diagon Alley. I'm so excited because uh I'm maybe Celestian Warbeck's biggest fan, second biggest fan behind Molly Weasley. I'll accept that. I love Christmas in Hogsme. There's Garland on all the stores. Garland on Greens. The vibes in Hogsme are always impeccable. They are somehow even better at Christmas time. And really actually at night at Christmas time is when they are really beautiful. H our timing. Celestina's out. Honestly, we've been hitting timing like nobody's business today. And it's snowing, but amazing. I caught the tail end of Celestina. Uh I might try to see a little more of it later if we happen to be here, but I I seeing just a bit of Celestina is all that really matters. Um but seeing a bit of Celestina was definitely on my to-do list and we can check that off because she is so fabulous in her winter best. Uh, she wears like this incredible red dress for the holidays and sings holiday wizarding tunes which are very, very fun. I love seeing Celestina. I love seeing Celestina year round. My rule with the wizarding shows is if you walk by and one's happening, go over and watch the rest of it. You don't really need to like carve out your day necessarily or check the times for them unless you're a major show buff or looking for something to do in which case maybe. But, uh, if you walk by on what's happening, just pause for a second because they are all so good. Celestina is no exception. Incredible. It's so Christmy. It's snowing. It is so funny seeing like the snow flow through the air and it's 85 degrees. Orlando. Let's check out Christmas in the Wizarding World. It's honestly mostly about vibes. There's not too much offering wise besides Celestina doing her Christmas set, but the vibes are good. So, let's check them out. Yeah, it's pretty much just cool decorations. For specialty snacks, there actually aren't a ton around outside of the very like like Grinch Mist has a number of special Christmas snacks like the Grinch cookie. Um, and then obviously the Grinch breakfast we did. But in this park, most of the special holiday snacks can be found at the holiday tribute store, which is a major must do. Even if you're not looking for merch, major must do. And if you are looking for merch, major must do. It's really the same. I just said it with different inflection. So, we are going to go find the holiday tribute store. It's funny. You know what would be really funny? And I know they're not going to do this because Simpsons Land is probably likely not long for this world, but it would be really funny if they did a Simpsons Christmas over there. Oh, Christmas Beat Builders. Oh my gosh. Universal Orlando has incredible streetphere that is entertainment that is geared towards just like stumble upon sort of vibes. You're supposed to sort of walk up and see it. But it is all listed. So if there's a show you really want to see, you can make sure that you make it to it all in the Universal app. Beat Builders. Incredible show. These guys are percussionists and they're basically supposed to be construction workers who are working on the scaffolding. The music moves them and they start making some tunes with the drums. Well, no drums, all the construction equipment. It's really cool. These guys are so talented and it's very fun. Year round, but at Christmas they do do a Christmas spin uh to the show. So, definitely recommend seeing it. And we have ended up right here in time to see uh at least Oh, no. It sounds like they're in the middle of the show. and we'll see the big finale. You know what this show needs? What? A little more cabbage. All right, Nick, we're not quite done yet. Do me a favor. Take this drumstick. Take this cowbell. Hope you're ready for this. All right, Nick, hit that thing. [Applause] It's a good You got to see the beat builders, man. There's pretty much all of the shows at Universal are incredible. Um, some of them for me are like just like I think Beeb buildilders is really peak for me. There's a dance show called Vamos that happens right here. Uh, you can see where I am in the New York area that I think is so incredible. Um, really recommend that one too just cuz it it is so much fun. I don't think they have a holiday overlay, but you can also see the Blues Brothers performing here. They do have a holiday overlay. You might see Marilyn Monroe performing with the Diamond Bellas. They do have a holiday overlay. Um, but whether or not basically if you hear a show happening, stop and watch it for a few minutes. I don't mean you have to watch the whole thing, but stop and watch it for a few minutes. Man, that is a honking Christmas tree. Um, so I think it's a little story time. You might know that Universal has a mascot for their holiday season. His name is Earl the Squirrel. He's a squirrel. And you might think, well, that's a strange mascot for a holiday season. They have good reason. The story behind the world the squirrel, which is allegedly a true story, is that they had a squirrel living in this tree. Uh, that caused some problems for the team members. They ended up nicknaming him Earl. And now Earl is the actual mascot of the theme park's holiday season, which I love deeply. That is so cool. So yeah, Earl apparently lived in that tree uh last year and I'm sure this year, but we will find out. They even sold a uh children's book with Earl's story of how he became the representation of Christmas at Universal. So cute. Okay, tribute store. Let's talk about it. Sometimes it's right here behind me. It's not right now. And it's really easy to tell because it's really obvious when it is there because they have a huge facade. Not here right now. So, it's going to be over in the Hollywood area. We will head over there and check the tribute store out. That's where I'm slowly wandering. Um, but I'm getting distracted cuz giant Christmas tree. Also, I've spotted a holiday photo op calling my name. It's going to take me forever to get to the holiday tribute store. But you know what? We're hanging out. It's the holidays. We're wandering. We're doing holiday stuff. I see holiday stuff. I walk toward it. It's not hard. Coca-Cola holiday photo op. It's cute. Your family can be in a little ornament. I don't ever have anybody here who can hold a camera for me, but you could be in a holiday ornament. So, in addition to a lot of the different areas of both parks having a bunch of different like visual decorations, there's also holiday music that kind of matches the areas playing too, which is really cool. Not always the case, but a lot of the time. Oh, my seeing holiday things and walking towards them thing is continuing cuz I see a giant pole just like a candy cane. But I think that's probably part of the parade route because we are walking it right now. Universal holiday parade featuring Macy's. That's right. Universal has actual Macy's balloons uh that they use in their holiday parade that happens here in Universal Studios at 5:30 p.m. each day. Uh it is an incredible parade. Amazing balloons, amazing performers, characters you love. Hands down, probably the biggest mustsee. In fact, if you're at Universal at a time that there is a parade, the parade is a mustsee. I don't even have to know what parade it is. Their parades are incredible. Um remember I mentioned Marilyn Marilyn and her diamonds and they're in their little holiday outfit. [Music] Can't stress enough that Doc Brown is just watching Marilyn from right here. Universal is wild, man. Just Doc Brown watching Marilyn Monroe and then behind him, Beetlejuice. Beetlejuice is shouting. You know, that's just Christmas to you. Uh, I love the Santa hat on the light post. We're going into the holiday tribute store. And again, this is how you know where they are. There's like a giant facade. Looks like a log cabin. Uh, this year the tribute store is in adorable Earl. Yeah, I told you about him. There he is. That's Earl the Squirrel. He's headed in right now, it looks like. But there he is. Love that guy. There you go. The tribute holiday market. So this year the theme of the tribute store is that you are walking into of course a more traditional Christmas market. As you can see you've got oh like little want to say toy shop. Look cute. Also smells good. It's a little nutcracker shop. They're making nutcrackers. It's crazy to just have like power tools in here. Sure you can't do anything with them but still. And then we're transported to the Wizarding World section, which is a little bit like a mountainous aurora borealis. There's a barn owl up there. So cool. Every year there's a lot of specialty holiday merch. Um, and a lot of my favorites come from the Grinch collections. Oh, Grinch Snowman. Sorry, he's right there. I'll see him in a second. A lot of my favorites come from the Wizarding World collections and the Grinch collections. So, Wizarding World this year, Christmas at Hogwarts is kind of the vibe. You can get like Christmas and Halloween pajamas. Lots of fun ornaments. Golden smidge. Yeah, this is a returning collection we see every year. So cute though. There we have Ron stockings. Yeah. And a lot of Grinch green. Locked do lots of Dr. Seuss. But it's really great because I think this is more like classic playful Christmas when you have the Grinch collections. Merry Grinch. um while still having a little bit of like that fun twist of it being Grinchy. And there's typically a lot of Grinch merch continues into this room. Um the theme is that you're wandering around like a Christmas village. I feel like you know those stores where like there's all those little buildings and then someone who built a Christmas village with like a little train. Um that's what I feel like I'm inside right now. It rules. And this is what I'm talking about when I say that you have to walk through the tribute store. Whether you're looking to shop or not, whether you want the silliest Santa hat you've ever seen or not, you have to walk through the holiday shop because they do have so many so much cool theming to be seen. And that's really what I'm always here for. And sometimes I buy stuff, sometimes I don't. Uh, but they do these tribute stores year round for all the different events. Um, so there's not always one. If you happen to come between snowman, that's cute. If you happen to come between events, there's not always a tribute store going on, but uh there often are. So, Martyra, Halloween Horror Nights, Holidays, there will be tribute stores and they rule and you should go through them. Um, also, if you have like repeat visits, they're often little Easter eggs to be noticed uh in the in the posters and things that are around. My personal favorite is Gerg the Llama. Gurg the llama is a tribute to part of the team for that designs like universal experiences person named Gurg and Greg and Gerg the Llama is a tribute to him but Gerg the llama can be found in the tribute stores all the time what did I tell you Gir I just said there's nods to him there it is Earl and G's epically curated collection of nutcrackers I got to say that is pretty epically curated that's so many nutcrackers we're in a insanely there's Earl we're in an insanely Christmy room. Tons of nutcrackers. This huge nutcracker that's mouth is a fireplace. That's so cool. They have a whole collection with the Universal Holiday Parade that has this adorable Santa stuff. Speaking of Santa, only way to see him is in the Universal Holiday Parade. Um, but the really fun thing about this room is that the nutcrackers are themed to some Universal things you might recognize. This one's really sending me. I'm really loving this final room because they have all the spirit jerseys in here. They have all the like jersey styles. Jungle roars. Jingle roars. Sorry. Jingle Roars. Oh, what does Earl have? The world's smallest nonfunctional nutcracker. Oh my gosh. And then um Shrek the Halls. Honestly, I'm not a fan of spirit jerseys, but this one does call to me. There's even a Back to the Future Christmas one. Shut up. Any universal monsters with Dracula? Why are they doing this to me? Silent fright. Why are they doing this to me? Why is this shelf just like for me? That was great as always. I love the Marilyn's now meeting folks down here if you wanted to meet her. Um I do love the holiday tribute store. It is so cool. Um here's the Earl the Squirrel meet and greet. actually has a dedicated spot this year with theming which is really neat. Uh you can meet Earl at Earl and Gergs Nutcracker Large and Emporium and Museum and Car Wash. I need a car wash. Now though most of the holiday offerings are in the tribute store, there are a handful like I mentioned, one of which the Central Park crepes. Uh which this year is the snicker doodle. It was a turkey last year. Snicker doodle this year. Holiday sugar dust on there. It's definitely a sweeter option with that snicker doodle crepe here. I always recommend the specialy crepes. They are so delicious. So, you can get them right there. Easy peasy. Now, you might find some holiday entertainment all around CityWalk as well as holiday decoration. The big star is the green and red coconut club. Coconut Club is a bar up on the higher level of Citywalk that does uh themed bars that go with the events at Universal. So, a spooky one for Halloween on Marty Gro, one for Marty GR, and of course, a holiday one for the holidays. The Coconut Club overlays are super fun. Uh they typically have some live entertainment that's pretty awesome. Definitely worth seeing. Also, we obviously just saw all of that themed merch in the tribute store, but you can also head into this big Universal store that's out here. And this first room on the corner has tons of all the same Christmas merch. You do not have to have a park ticket. And there's something with merch you want to buy. And also, Universal is very good about having the merch available multiple places, including outside the parks in Citywalk. So, if you don't want to carry it around um and you don't have like package delivery to your hotel, a couple of exceptions to this, if you love something Wizarding World or anything epic, just go ahead and grab it when you see it or, you know, circle back to that place. Here's that children's book I was telling you about. Circle back and grab it just in case. But this store has a huge Wizarding World section that has all the Wizarding World merch. Um Christmas included. Has all the Christmas merch at the front. said, \"Typically, you can find it all in the big Universal Studios store at CityWalk. Don't count on it being at your hotel, but the big store in Citywalk has pretty much everything from the two north campus parks. Epic doesn't usually have Epic merch, so if you want Epic merch, get it while you're at Epic.\" And they've actually semi-reently expanded this store, so it just kind of keeps going. Um, and there is some Epic merchandise, Nintendo specifically here, and a full butterbeer bar now. So, you can get cold or frozen butterbeer. Don't believe they have the hop, though. Um, and then it continues into the Nintendo store. So, here's where you can find, you know, Nintendo merchandise specifically from Epic, like my monsters merchandise. Can't really find it in here. Now, they do have a lot of Epic merchandise across the way at the Epic Universe preview center. Um, but it's not all of it. So, again, if you see something at Epic that you love, buy it at Epic. Also, the hotels have tons of holiday fun, too. So, ask the front desk when you check in at your hotel what's going on holiday wise. Make sure you don't miss anything. But for us, it's getting kind of close to parade time. So, I want to go grab my spot. We're going to check out the Universal Holiday Parade featuring Macy's. We're going to see Shrek. We're going to see Minions. We're going to see Santa and of course a lot of really incredible floats and really incredible balloons that are to die for. While I'm walking over though, let's talk a little bit about the holiday tour. So, if you want to see all of the really fun stuff that I've seen today, plus a lot more without hassle, there is an upcharge way to do so with the Universal Holiday Tour. This is basically a holiday geared guided tour that will take you through all the best of the holidays and some exclusive experiences. One of those is seeing the parade floats and the balloons, getting photo ops with them. Um, and of course, you'll get to skip any lines to meet the Grinch. You get VIP seating at the hoola day that we saw earlier. It'll get even closer than me without the weight in the sun. So, if you want to have a great holiday time, it is a little bit of an upcharge, but my friend Miranda, she does it every single year. It is her go-to theme park experience, the holiday tour. So, it's an incredible experience, and it's not as insanely priced as like some guided theme park tours. It gets you through all the all the fun holiday stuff. [Music] Oh, and a little bit of mistletoe. Like I said, incredible parade. Absolute must do. And now we're going to since the sun is going down, head back over to Islands of Adventure, try to catch Holiday Lights at Hogwarts, which is the projection show on Hogwarts Castle. And you want to talk about magic? This thing is so magical. It happens continuously from dusk onward. and it is a Christmy production show uh that sort of takes you through Hogwarts at Christmas time. Very heartwarming and a great finale to our night. It's Christmas time. [Music] Moral of the story, I love the holidays at Universal. If you are still here, like this video and drop this secret code in the comments so I know you made it all the way. Plus, don't forget to subscribe. We upload tips, games, info, and more from Universal and beyond all week because we are serious about fun. I'll see you next time. And goodbye friends in there. I don't know. You know what? A person is a person no matter how small. No matter how small. That is true. Bye, friends. Happy holiday. Happy holiday. Thank you."

      "transcript": "I I [Music] take me home today. Take me out. Take me back into sweet. Good morning everyone. Welcome to a brand new Disney and detail vlog. And this time we are somewhere different. We're at Disneyland Paris. I know. I've never been here before, you know. So, I'm looking forward to this. I haven't been for a couple of years. I think it was probably 2023 and I've only ever been twice. So, for me, this is a bit new with planning cuz the first trip Becky planned that we did in 2019. Then, I did a press trip I was kindly invited on. So, this is the first time I have planned the trip, which has been really exciting actually. So, if anyone's watching this for the first time, if you've just happened upon this video, hello and welcome. I'm Victoria and this is Paul. Hi. Um, I've been going to the Disney parks for years and years. Um, 23 years in total. Mostly Walt Disney World as I said, but also I have been to Disneyland Paris and um, California and also Tokyo as well. And this is my third ever Disneyland Paris trip. And we're staying off site this time. We are actually in the Adagio SIS Valdi Europe. So, it's an off-site hotel close to the Disney parks. And it's really nice actually, isn't it? This room is great. It's lovely. It is really lovely. What I will say though is that if you're going to be getting a buzz from the train station to here, be careful what you say to the bus drivers cuz we did land up somewhere else. Yeah, we got a bit lost on the way to the hotel. Um, like I say, I've never stayed in Northite hotel before, so we ended up on a what I think was a public bus rather than a Disney bus. We ended up at the Vald Europe shopping center, and then we had to walk over, but it's fine. It's actually only like a 10-minute walk from the shopping center to here. There's a really nice petissery just down the road and I will insert some footage in a minute of this room because I did a little room tour when we arrived. Um, but this is our first morning. So, we're off to Disneyland Park this morning to experience all the Christmas stuff and we can't wait, can we? Looking forward to it. Looking forward to seeing all the Christmas stuff and and obviously I'm new to all this like anyway. Full stop. You know, I've been to Florida once and now I'm at Paris for the first time. So, yeah, I'm just looking forward to the whole lot really. It's such a beautiful time of year in any of the Disney parks and to see it for the first time at Christmas I think is going to be amazing and I've never seen it at this time of year. I've only ever been at the end of January before. So seeing it all at Christmas is new to me. There's going to be a parade. I hear the parade is absolutely amazing. We're going to be doing a full day today. So looking forward to it. Yeah. So come along with us. We've got my ears ready. I'm going to get those on as soon as we get there and just can't wait for a day in the park. So if you're not already subscribed, please do. There's going to be multiple vlogs from this trip and then I'm going to be back in Walt Disney World in January. But should we go? Let's get going. We've just come down to get the bus to the parks. There is a free bus from this hotel. The hotel is just over here, the entrance. You actually have to cross the road and just come down here to get the bus. So, the stop is not right outside. Apparently, at some points in the day, you actually do catch it outside the hotel, but first thing in the morning, you have to come over here. So, just thought I'd point that out so you don't end up in the wrong place. There is actually a sign here that says Adagio, you are in the right place with a bus on it. So, we needed that. Yeah, we needed that sign. And while we're waiting for this bus or actually doing the bus journey, I will put in the footage of the room so you can see that. And the next time you'll see us, hopefully we will be walking towards the park cuz I'm so excited. So, this is the room. We've just arrived. So, I'm filming this as soon as we've got here before we mess anything up so you can see it exactly how it looks. This is the bathroom, which is significantly bigger than the one we just had in the hotel we stayed in in the center of Paris that had the tiniest bathroom I've ever seen. But this is really nice. There is a bath as well. Nice sink area there with extra towels. And then if you come out here, there is a wardrobe and a dustpan as well in case you need to clean up a bit. That seems funny, but actually when you have these wooden floors, if you're staying here for several nights, you can get like just hair and bits and it's not very nice to walk around on. So, it's good to have that dust pan and brush because you can give it a little sweep every day just to keep it clean. Then got the bed in here. And it is a smalish room, but it's perfectly fine for what we need. And like I say, the one we just had in Paris was quite small, isn't it? Got some nice artwork there. Then coming around to here, it has a little kitchen area. There's even a dishwasher in here, which is really neat. So, what have we got there? Dishwasher in the middle. And I'm guessing a fridge maybe here on the left. Yep. quite a big size refrigerator as well. You have a hob, so you can actually do some cooking. I don't think we're going to be doing any cooking, but you can. And a coffee machine there. I don't think there's a kettle though for tea, is there? There's no kettle for tea. No. So, that's one thing we don't have. There's a toaster up the top there. Okay. And then plates and stuff in there. The other thing is is that there's no pods. Oh, okay. Maybe you have to buy some. Then over here you've got a small table and a desk. Got a phone there and then the TV. And there is also another chair which I'm very thankful for because I do like there to be a second chair if there's two of you in the room. So if you were eating, you could pull both chairs up to that little round table. This is the view we have. There is a swimming pool. I don't believe that that is in use at the moment. It is entirely too cold. And she did say there's like a fitness center, but she specifically didn't mention a swimming pool cuz it's November. So, we're not going to be wanting to go in there anyway. Oh my gosh, look at this. The hotel is so beautiful. That's the Disneyland Hotel. You can actually see into the park from that hotel. It's their flagship one. Quite pricey, I would imagine. That hotel looks absolutely beautiful. It's just stunning. And they've had a refurbishment which was very lengthy. It was actually closed for a little while. This park is known for being one of the most beautiful. Like when you see the castle, it's a bit different as well. And uh it is lovely. And there's a dragon. Dragon in the castle. You can go in. We'll have to see that. We've got to see that. Suddenly very excited by that idea. I like that kind of stuff. I am loving this music. This is so good. I love Monsters Inc. so much. One day we will stay here. We have to. It's just so beautiful. And I have heard that you can get a clock which is like this. You can actually buy yourself a clock to have at home. And Paul has been saying since we moved in together that we need a clock. Have you not? I have. So that would be a pretty good one, wouldn't it? That' be a compromise for our living room because I've said we don't need one. That's right. But maybe we need that one. Look at that. That's Mickey. Oh, is Mickey up there. Mickey's up there. A there he is. Love that Mickey's there to greet you as soon as you come in. So, we've just been into City Hall to pick up our tickets and I just want to take this opportunity to say a huge huge thank you to the Disney team who have very, very kindly provided us with park admission. Thank you so so much. really honestly. They've provided us with park admission and the premier access ultimate for our days in the parks because it's Paul's first time. So, a massive thank you to Disney for that. We really, really are so grateful. I mean, flip the camera aim, bab. I mean, look at that. Paul is just in wonder at this point at the uh park entrance. Yeah. I mean, look, even the old police officers look even. We want to try and get to everything as much as we can over the next few days. So, huge thank you to Disney for that. And as you walk in here, if you are used to Walt Disney World, it is very familiar. Obviously, huge tree there and the main street vehicles and the shops and everything, the emporium here. So, this all does look very similar. One thing that is quite different though is the castle. The castle in Paris is known for being extremely beautiful and it really, really is. Let's just round this corner and you are going to see it. There it is. [Music] I love hearing people's reactions. Listening to people as they walk in was absolutely amazing. I could just sit here all day. Just people watch. Yeah. I'll zoom in a bit, but we will get much closer so you can see it. But there we go. And we've got some snow here. Wow. Paul's so happy. He loves He loves Christmas. I am literally in my element. This is amazing. Our first moment walking in to Main Street and we've got the snow. This is so good. [Music] [Applause] Just about to make a plan for our uh first thing that we're going to do. But we got completely swept up in like a Christmas moment there. And what we're doing is we're just walking up and down this street all day. Yeah. Starting to see the castle a bit closer up now. Really is very pretty. Just heading this back way towards Fantasy Land, which is going to be our first destination today. Just in front of us here is restaurant Bellote, which is where they do the Mickeyshaped pizza. We are going to be eating there later today. Actually never got round to that the last couple of times I was here. And I did ask for recommendations from you guys, and lots of you recommended the pizza. You can see Small World just coming up here on the right. Both here and in Tokyo and probably some of the other parks as well. It looks so impressive from the outside. the one in Florida. You kind of can't see anything from the outside of it, but look at that. Soon as we've had a drink, we'll be back to do this. There's a few kiosks here. Hopefully, we'll be able to get some coffee. But look at all of these sweet treats. They have these candy apples, strawberries on a stick coated in chocolate. Oh my gosh. And marshmallows. I'm getting that later. Yeah, these here look like those foamy strawberries that you Yeah, they do. We don't have our coffee yet. We are having our first taste of trash can dining, which does happen. There's no tables. I've put the the napkin down, so we're good. And Paul has got the duck breast and cheese gallette and rockets. And I've got the Nutella crepe. We just had to get a crepe. And we're going to grab some coffee in a second. Some of those kiosks don't actually do coffee, but they had various things. No. Yeah. But it looks nice. It smells good. Yeah. The total cost was €13.50. So, as well as the crepes over at these kiosks here, they had pretzels. There was also waffles, wasn't there? Then those sweet treats that we showed. Sorry, I'm sitting in the face. He's already started. There's some mold wine there as well. Um, there was one other thing that they had. What was it that you went to have a look at? Salami. Salami like in a cone they had as well. Yeah. So, those were the options of these little kiosks here. It's a whole meal um pancake. Buckwheat gallette I think it said. You probably haven't got any of the duck yet cuz it's usually like in the middle. Good. So good. Yeah. Okay. First taste of the Disneyland Paris crepe. And I've got loads of Nutella on this bit. You just can't beat an Intella crepe. Becky and I got really into these. We had a lot of these when we were here last time. So, on this trip, we're going to rate everything that we eat out of 10. I'm going to give the crepe a seven. That seems like it might be a little bit low cuz I do love them, but I don't want to go in too high, right? No, I'm going to give my one again about a seven. And we're going to go on Small World right now since we're right here. So, the coffee will have to wait. We'll find some shortly. And just to show you here, the Premier Access Ultimate is um accessed through your phone. You link it up and you can just use it in the Disneyland Paris app. You just tap that and it shows you your QR code and you scan it at the entrance to the attractions. I love the SW World starts outside here. It's just very different. Slinky. Yeah. [Music] Oh, Blinky Hippo. Isn't that Blinky? That's special just for Florida. Oh, we got Sassy Gator on this one. guitar playing cactus who is joined by a ukulele playing donkey in this one. [Music] [Music] Love a bit of Small World to start the day though. That was so good, wasn't it? Yeah, I love it. It's like I said, you know, somewhere where you've come in, you've got all the hype of what you've just walked through. Yeah. You need that little bit of a calm day. Yeah. So, it's a good place to go for that. Really? It is. And it was nice that there's some different stuff from the Florida one cuz I see that one so often. And I think now we're going to head into Toad Hall. We're just going to get a coffee. We have to go and visit Toad Hall. Mr. Toad is my absolute favorite character, as many of you will know. Um, so we need to go in there, even if it's just to get a drink. Look how good Toad Hall looks. I think we're a little bit keen. There might be about 8 minutes until it opens. As a Mr. Toad fan, this is like the ultimate that they have Toad Hall here. They don't have this in Disney World, and I really wish they did. And they don't have the attraction in Disney World anymore. They used to. Mr. Toad's Wild Ride is in California. They still have it. Oh, they got their Christmas decorations up, too. Oh, wow. It's so cool. I love it. This looks like a very clean English pub. It does. Definitely getting English pub vibes. Here you can get fish and chips, crispy plant-based bites, which are like veggie nuggets, salads, um, and they got a vegan salad as well. They have squid fritters and fries. Look at these on the floor. Little Mr. Toad heads. I love that. They have fancy seats in here. got our coffee. And this is actually a really nice place just to get a coffee cuz they're in proper cups. You can sit down. Was it hot? We did get some fries as well cuz we kind of wanted to see what they were like and see if we didn't want to eat a full meal or anything. We were just sharing some fries. They're very fresh cuz it's just opened. So, they're like boiling hot. We've not had one bad cup of coffee since we've been here. No, actually the coffee has been good everywhere. It is stronger sometimes here than you know, but you get less, don't you? Yeah, there's less of it, but I think there's just less milk, which is a good thing, probably. And we're just going to make a plan of action for our next attraction where we have this coffee. Let's have a look in the app. You can check the app to see wait time. Same as in Disney World, you can check um which restaurants are around, where things are. It works very much in the same way. I forgot to mention what I'm wearing today as well. So, you will see I have my Merry Magic um Christmas sweater on. This is from Magic Maker Ears. It's very kindly sent to me. And I also have my Orbit Key Urban Sling bag. I am obsessed with cross body bags since I did my last trip just for vlogging. It is so much easier being able to grab things, put my camera in there, and I don't have to keep taking the backpack off or like a shoulder bag which keeps falling off. So, I love these cross bodies, and this one is so good. It actually takes loads of stuff. It doesn't look all that big, but the amount of stuff that I got in here is crazy. There's all sorts of different pockets. Oh, and I put Spice in here as well. This is Catherine's character. Jingy, I couldn't find it last minute. So, Spice is with us on this trip. I'm going to hang her on the bag in a second. And Paul has got the Donald Duck one that he's using today. And it's got Donald's little tail on there. Absolutely love it. But they're such good quality. Really, really um like sturdy. You can feel the zips are very, very strong as well. Absolutely amazing. So, thank you so much for sending these to us and I will link them below. Back to the plan of action. Obviously, we already established that Buzz Lightyear is under refurbishment. I've got a feeling that Phantom Manor is as well. It is showing as closed. Um, and it doesn't look as if it's just temporarily down. I think it might actually be closed for refurbishment, which is such a bummer because it's my absolute favorite. While we're here in Fantasy Land, I think we will probably do um Peter Pan. Then, Pirates is right next door. So, maybe Peter Pan and Pirates next. They're all done in there. And I was in Mr. Toad heaven with all that artwork. I took loads of photos. There were tons that I would have just absolutely loved to have up on my wall at home. And since we're right here next to Peter Pan's flights, I think we're going to do that next. Their ships have got two rows here in Paris. In Florida, it's just one. [Music] [Music] That was so good, wasn't it? And we didn't do that in Florida, so that was your first time. No, that was actually really, really good. But yeah, you actually feel like you're going over London. Yeah, it's cute, isn't it? I love that. It's really nice. It is really nice. I love it. Well, we're on a roll. We're going to go straight on to Pirates of the Caribbean. And this one, if I remember correctly, is longer than the Disney World version. There's a few more scenes in it. As you can see, you scan it slightly differently here. So, you put your phone underneath the thing and you don't tap it like you do in Disney World. Don't ask me how I know that because yes, I embarrassingly was trying to tap it earlier and I was like, \"Nothing's happening.\" And then I was like, \"Oh, okay.\" You put it underneath. So, that was a bit of a fail on my part. Paul enjoyed it though. He thought it was funny. [Music] [Laughter] [Music] She work. [Music] [Music] That was so good. I loved it. This pirates is so much longer than the one in Florida. There's a lot more at the beginning before you get into the main part of the ride. Just different scenes. I love the like ghosty pirate at the end. Absolutely loved that. That's my favorite thing I've done so far. Definitely. And we're just having a little browse around the store here. They have Phantom Manor, Big Thunder Mountain, Tower of Terror, and Pirates. These are actually really nice. These would be a lovely gift for a Disney fan. I feel like these would be good for Becky, but they're quite small. She's a big mug person, so they're probably a bit small, but I really like those. Got some Jack Skellington stuff. You said you needed a thicker coat. I'd wear that. Yeah, I believe you. I think you would actually. And they have Jack here. Oh, look at his legs. And they also have Santa Jack. This is really cool. That's actually really nice. Just the Jack and Sally. The way that her hair is kind of makes a heart. I really like that. I'm not sure about wearing that to work or are you sure? Ever for that. Josh, if you get to watch it, just have let me know what you think. And they have these Jack ears, but they're like a holographic kind of shimmer. They're really nice. Now, those are some funky socks. I would wear them. There's a lot going on here. Got Jack there. We have some bats. I feel like they'd be a little bit challenging to wear. They're not dayto-day socks, let's be real. Oh, yeah. I'd wear them to work. And some of you might remember from Mine and Becky's trip, Captain Jack was walking to do a meet and greet over by the big pirate ship and Becky literally chased him down. She is a big Captain Jack fan. I'll link that vlog below if anybody wants to watch that. We were hoping to do the Pinocchio attraction as well, but that is currently closed. I think it's down for refurbishment along with Phantom Mana and Buzz. Sometimes at this time of year, um whether it's like November, December, January, February off kind of season. I guess they do put things down for refurbishment rather than in the summer, which totally makes sense. And speaking of the pirate ship, look, here it is. Got Jeie doing a meet and greet over here. Just checking out some of the snacks as we go past. And this place has some Christmy biscuits. Minnie's jingle bread biscuit or Mickey's ginger jingle bread. I can't say that properly. And then they have a Christmas cupcake. You can also get waffle. Are they waffles? Looks like. Yeah. Mini Mickey waffles. Next up, we're just going to see if we can ride the boat or sail on the boat, I should say. The paddle boat cuz Paul really wants to do that. He was very upset about that. I missed I missed the one in Florida, didn't I? Yeah. And it's closed for good now. I was absolutely devastated. So, like let's He actually really was. So, let's try and do this one. Oh my gosh, I love these ear muffs. I've got ears on. Can you model this? Nice. Oh, no. Not another one. I mean, I'm really not I'm even more unsure of as a combo with those two, but these would be really good if you're watching like the fireworks and parades at nighttime and get chilly. Yeah, they'd be really good. They've got ones with bows on as well. And you can get scarves and gloves and things like that as well. So if you have forgotten to bring things like that and you're cold. We're on the approach to Big Thunder Mountain. We'll definitely be doing that one maybe after lunch. Becky and I loved this. It's a little bit longer again, I think, than the Florida one, but this is the best version of Big Thunder Mountain in my opinion. I love it. This is such a great view as you're approaching here because you have Bantam Manor in the background. Then we have the boat, and then you have Big Thunder Mountain right here as well. I'm so sad about Phantom Manor. I can't even tell you. Look how good it looks. That was good timing. We got on just as this one had let off the other people. And look at the manor there. Get a closer look now. Let's zoom in. It's so awesome. It actually looks really creepy from the outside. I would say the one in Disney World looks a little bit more posh looking. This one looks dead creepy and like a real rickety old mansion. And all of the Disney parks throughout the world have their own version. So they're all called something slightly different. It's one of my favorite things ever. The old Ravenwood mansion. I heard it was hard to churn up. I might just wander over things. We're just on our way to get lunch and we're going to the Cocoa restaurant to get burritos. But we just saw somebody with some loaded nachos which look really nice. That sounds nice. That's got beef on it though, right? Yeah. Tomatoes, onions, coriander, and guacamole. And the other one's bacon sauce and cheese. We have our food finally. I will say that took quite some time. How long do you think that was? Probably about half an hour. Yeah, about half an hour. It was about half an hour just to queue up to get food. I did try and do the click and collect, but when I clicked on that, it just said it was closed, which it obviously isn't, so I don't know what was going on there. But anyway, Paul has a burrito. This is something that you guys recommended to us. I had so many comments when I asked about quick service. Everyone said, \"Come here for a burrito.\" He's got the chicken one, but no guac cuz he is not a guac fan. No, I'm not a fan of avocado. We did also get ourselves these nachos which were outside at the kiosk. The guac is on the side. You can see it down there at the end. Um so hopefully that will be all right for you. You can just eat around that. I got myself some onion rings as well. But Paul's having the burrito cuz I'm not a fan of them. Tuck in. I'm always confused what end of burrito. Yeah, I'm never sure about that. I don't know if there's a right or wrong end. And I should mention they were happy to do the um burrito without the guac. So you could have got it without any of the components. I think looks really full. Tastes amazing so far. Spicy. No. Loads of you guys actually mentioned the burritos here. That was one of the most recommended things. I'm going to try one of these nachos from outside. They've probably gone a bit soggy now because they've got tomato on. And there is a sauce which I think might be a little spicy. It's got a little kick to it afterwards. Um, so if you don't like spicy food at all, then maybe don't get these. Yeah, it's like a slightly spicy nacho sauce. But it's just good actually. All in all, it's quite nice, isn't it? Yeah, you could you could have got these with different toppings on. They did have ones with beef on, but obviously I don't like that, so we got these. Onion rings are huge. Sorry. Yeah. Look at the size of this onion ring. This is like scary big. They're good, too. What would you give your burrito out of 10? A size another seven. Uhhuh. Yeah. I'm going to give the nachos, and I will have put a picture in, by the way, to show you what they look like. I'm going to give these a six, maybe a 6.5. No, a six. Let's not get too carried away. I'm saving the high scores for something that's really like blows me away. So, new plan. We are actually over by the hub again now because the Christmas parade is in about 25 minutes and we figured we would try and catch the first one. It just gives us some more options later on of what we're doing. And I figure maybe the second one might be busier, but I don't know. I think they'll probably both be equally as busy cuz apparently this parade is absolutely beautiful. And tonight we were potentially going to stay for the fireworks show, but when me and Paul were talking about it when we were eating there, we got out first thing this morning. We were up at I think like 6, something like that. So staying till 10 for the um firework show and then obviously you'll be here a lot later than that by the time it's done and you get back. I think that's going to be too much for one day. So this vlog is going to have the Christmas parade in it. And then our next day in Disneyland Park, which will be not the next vlog, but the one after, we'll have the evening show and we'll start a bit later that morning cuz it can just be too much if you're trying to do all day long. It's just a lot. You get very tired. do. There's a lot to do. If you're coming to these kind of places, don't come just for one day. You need to come for several days. We need a few days definitely cuz there is so much going on and we haven't even done the other park yet. So, that's tomorrow. Look at that. Where the light is hitting it and the cloud has all gone. It was really gray and rainy this morning and now we've got this absolutely beautiful sky. This is stunning. [Music] David [Music] Christmas. Oh yeah. [Music] A Christmas tree just for you. A holiday of fantasy. A holiday of fun. Surprise. [Music] Christmas. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Christmas. [Music] [Applause] Oh my goodness, that was so good, wasn't it? It was absolutely amazing. Yeah, it was really good. I'd heard good things about that parade and someone actually let me kind of sit down next to them. There was a little gap and they were kind of like, \"Oh, come sit here.\" So, I managed to get such a good view and it was perfect. It was so good. Absolutely loved it. Yeah. Can't say anymore. It was great. It was perfect. Music was great. The performers were incredible. So many characters. Just so nice seeing like thousands of people together actually enjoying themselves. Yeah. Seeing the like the kids' faces when the characters are going by. It really is just so cute. I would definitely recommend seeing that parade. It's on twice a day. It's not that late. I think one of them's at 5. I want to say 45 or something is the last one. And this one was just before 4:00. So, it's not like nighttime as well. So, if you have small children, they should still be awake obviously to see that. This Thunder Mountain, I think, is the best one. It is such a good big Thunder Mountain. I love the one in Florida, but this one is something else. So, let's go do that. [Music] [Music] Well, what did you think of that, Big Thunder? Do you know what? Um, I don't like roller coasters as people know, but that was absolutely amazing. I think that's kind of got me over my mild fear of roller coasters. Yeah, it was so good. I really will say that I I was scared when I got on, as you know, shaking. He was a bit nervous, but then halfway through my aunt just went up in the air. I sort of joined in with everybody else and I was screaming all sorts of stuff. Absolutely thought it was brilliant. Yeah, this one here um is I think is my favorite Big Thunder Mountain. I love the ones everywhere else that I've been. Tokyo had one as well, California, but I love this one. Oh. [Music] Oh, I love this. That was perfect timing, was it? Not even planned. [Music] Can't get over how beautiful this castle is with the golden hour light on it. Let me just zoom in. There you go. You can see it properly now. It's absolutely stunning. And with this Christmas music going on as well. If anything is ever going to put you in the Christmas mood, it is this. This day that we've had today, seeing the parade, there's music. It's absolutely beautiful. And we're just about to take you down Main Street here to see the other decorations, to see the tree, and there's just so much going on. We didn't get to see much of this earlier. Look at Main Street here. Everything is starting to glitter. All the lights are coming on. This is very Christmassy. This is Christmas. When we get home, we are putting the tree up. Yes. Yes. Okay. I I I don't know. Normally, you're resistant to early. That's what I'm saying. I don't know. Really? Look at this. I mean, do you not want this going on? Can I just say something which everybody will appreciate? I'm still getting Back to the Future vibes. I'm sure everyone will love that. So, it's good to know that not just in Florida, but everywhere. Paul has deemed Main Street to be like the town in Back to the Future. Absolutely. What What could I do to convince you that we can have our tree when we get home? I reckon we should let the subscribers vote on it. Maybe I'll do a poll on Instagram. Yeah, do a poll on Instagram saying Paul says no, Victoria says yes. Is it too soon to put the Christmas tree up? I bet I know the answer. No, I reckon it'll be quite divided actually. Yeah. Look how pretty everything is though. This is beautiful. We are going to go into the store in a minute. [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm inside one of the stores now. This is one that's got like the car in the window with Kella there. Just looking at some of the merch. This is like a really fleecy cozy top. I don't know if you can see. It's like super fleecy. It's like a pull- on hoodie. Oh, and the hood has actually got mini ears on it. That's cute. That's €60. Got these more classic kind of jumpers. That's nice. That one's €50. This is nice. It's one of those denim jackets, but it has then like the jersey sleeves and it's got Sorcerer Mickey on the back. I love that. That one's 70. They've got the giant Mickey bag. They have this available at Walt Disney World. Also, they've got an offer on this. Let's just see what it says. You can get this for €30 for every €40 purchase. So, you have to be purchasing €4 worth of other stuff to then get this for 30. This is a new Loungefly that they have. I love that. That's €100. They are kind of pricey. This sweatshirt is really nice. That one's €7. It's got that kind of fluffy detailing going on there. I really like that actually. Just walking through the cable car bake shop. What do they have in here? Croissant panaka. Then they have a cheesecake, cupcake, a carrot cake. Then they have sandwiches and things as well. And here is Victoria's. We're definitely going to come here because loads of you suggested this place. I think it's mainly sweet stuff like waffles and pancakes maybe and things like that. Right up nice street. Yeah. H we have a menu here so I can tell you what they have. A Nutella Mickey waffle with whipped cream. Mickey waffle with salted butter, caramel sauce, whipped cream, and meringue. They have cold brew coffees, regular coffee, other drinks. So yeah, this looks like a desserty kind of place. And on this side, I think they had some seasonal things. Winter cold macchiato, hot chocolate, speculoo flavored syrup. Oh, that looks nice. Correct me if I'm wrong. Is that not like biscoff speculus? Yes. Yeah. And then whipped cream and cookie pieces. And it has here available soon, so not yet. A ule log. Um that looks like a little house. I think it's sharing nut. So it's a to share. Maybe it's bigger than it looks. And a Jack Skellington pumpkin king pastry. So some interesting stuff there. It looks very much like the Plaza restaurant looks in the Magic Kingdom. It's that type of vibe. And we will head down here later. Discovery Arcade. Never overlook this area because it goes the whole length of Main Street. If you want to avoid the main kind of busy part at the moment, a lot of people are waiting for the parade. You can actually exit the park going straight down through there. And this restaurant, I believe, is kind of similar to Crystal Palace. Yeah. So, that's similar. It's an all you can eat buffet. They do breakfast here, I think, as well. Plaza Gardens. Paul just heard the word breakfast. He's instantly excited. We're currently just heading away from Main Street because the parade is about to happen and obviously it will get a bit crazy around there. So, I think we might go and investigate the Mickeyshaped pizza at Bellanote, which is the place that you suggested. So many of you suggested that place. I think we're going to share a pizza. There's only so much stomach space in a day. We've had quite a lot today, I feel like, already. Um, but we've only got a few days here, so we have to, you know, get all the snacks in for research purposes to show you guys, of course. Yeah. All for research, honest. This lighting is pretty special right now. It's not fully dark yet. No, it's still beautiful though, isn't it? But the sun is going down. We are going to cover Discovery Land, by the way, in more detail in the next vlog from this park. So, not next week, but the week after for you guys. And in that one, we're going to do the attractions in Discovery Land. Maybe try some food there. We haven't really touched on it this time because we wanted to do some different stuff on both days. This is so pretty. [Music] I just love the music so much. I hope the poll on Instagram goes in my favor for the Christmas tree. No comments. You'll be happy about it if we have our tree up. I guarantee I absolutely love Christmas. Let's get that out of now. It's not the fact that I do not want a Christmas tree in the living room. It's a bit like setting off fireworks in May. Why do people do that? It's not bonfire night. It's not like that though. My thinking is you only get to have your Christmas tree once a year. You want to overall look at the lighting over there. Here we are. Pizzeria Bellanote. And loads of you said the Mickeyshaped pizza is the thing to eat. Is the most suggested I would say of everything that you guys said. So, let's do it. Let's try it. I was worried it might be busy in here, but it's actually really nice and quiet, so that's good. So the pizza Mickey, you can get pepperoni or like a margarita, cheese and tomato. They also have pasta, rietoni pasta, Neapolitan sauce, garlic bread. Here we are, the Mickey pizza that you all recommended. We got the cheese and tomato one. We got the meal. So it comes with half a garlic baguette. You could have had a salad. It also comes with a drink. We just got a bottle of water cuz we haven't had nearly enough water today. And of course, two cappuccinos, which seems to be our standard everywhere we go now is two cappuccinos. But let's see what this is like. This is more than enough to share, I would say, wouldn't you? It's big. Yeah. Always remember to drink water. It's not actually hot here in Paris, but you need to drink some water. Otherwise, you end up just drinking like coffees and exciting drinks and never any of this. I drink a lot of this at home. See what Paul's verdict is. That actually takes me back to a memory. My dad and my mom used to take me to a place in Birmingham called Speedy Pizzas. And it tasted like that. And it tastes exactly right. Oh, that's funny. Is it nice? It's nice. It's very nice. Yep. Give this a whirl. It's nice. The cheese is nice. It's got like nice flavored cheese. Sometimes mozzarella and cheese on pizzas can taste like, you know, Yeah. like rubbery. like it doesn't have much taste, but this actually does taste nice and it is a really good size. So through the day if you are eating different bits and pieces and snacks and stuff like that, you could totally share this. Let's just try the garlic bread. It's nice. I mean, it basically tastes like one that you would buy and put in the oven at home, you know, like a garlic baguette. I can't say anything special about that. No, it just it's just like a normal garlic baguette that you would put in the oven. But I like those. So, what would you rate this out of 10? So, so far this has probably got to be the best thing that I've eaten here. Okay, good. So, I'm going to say an eight. 8 out of 10. 8 out of 10. That's for the pizza. Yeah, I would say I'm going to give this a 7.5 cuz I also think this is really good. It's really nice and it probably is the nicest thing I've had all day. But again, I want to save my, you know, eights, nines, tens for something that's I mean, that's 10 is basically couldn't be any better, right? So, yeah. 7.5 I would give this. It's nice and it's really nice in here. I have noticed that about their quick service restaurants. They all look really good. We're on the move again. And look at Small World all lit up here. That looks very, very cool. See, I can imagine that being shrunken down and being hung on a tree. Yeah, like a mini ornament. I wonder if that exists. That would be cool. That would be We're just heading back here into fantasy land again. Paul is dancing. We're just heading back here to maybe get the strawberries on a stick for our dessert because a lot of you mentioned that as well with the chocolate coated strawberries. So, we're going to try and get that if the kiosk is still open. Maybe ride the teacup ride, I think, if we're not going to feel sick after our pizza and chocolate strawberries. Hopefully not. And then after that, I do have my Patreon live stream. So, I'm going to be showing around by the castle and back here again in Fantasy Land on the live stream. If anyone's interested in Patreon, I will link it below. It is still open. Chocolate strawberries are one of my favorite things at Disney World to have, but here you get several of them on a stick, which is a bit different. You can get just the strawberries, or it looks like they have milk chocolate, dark chocolate, or white. And then same for the marshmallows on a stick, too. They do look so good, don't they? This all looks so nice. And I love marshmallows on a stick, too. We're debating whether to, again, for research purposes, try both. Here we go. We've got the chocolatecoated strawberries, the milk chocolate, and then we've got the white chocolatecoated marshmallows. We're gonna share both of these. They look so good. So, I broke the end off. Chuck it all in. That there is a nine. That's an eight and a half. I'm at a bit of a crazy angle right now cuz I'm trying to charge the camera while using it, which is never advisable, but here we are. Going to have to get Paul to break me off a strawberry cuz I'm trying to hold this. Look at that. M. That is a lovely strawberry. Yeah, that's a nine. That's almost a nine and a half. Well, we can't be throwing around tens when things like the creme brulee pson exist at Disney World, which is a solid 10. So, whoever recommended this Yeah, thank you. Several people recommended this. Marshmallow time. That's an 8.5. Agree. But the strawberry has it as being superior. Strawberry is so good. We're just going to head over and ride the teacup ride while we're waiting for the live stream. Look how pretty this looks at night with all these lanterns. I love that. [Music] It's not too bad. It actually makes me dizzy. It doesn't make me feel sick, but I feel dizzy. We're going the opposite way now. [Music] There's a reason that this ride is short. Don't want everyone getting sick. Are you getting dizzy yet? No, I am a little bit. We're just having a look in this store which is in fantasy land. It looks very much like I think it was called Sir Mickey's. Whether it still is in the Magic Kingdom. I have to say it. I hope that actually fits my hands properly. This is a very Becky sized mug. She'd like how big that is. It's actually huge. Like you see my hand like that's actually like hard to get my hand drowned. That's actually just right for me. Yeah, that is nice. I like that artwork of a curious labyrinth. That's really nice. This notebook is cute. And it's got these as the tabs on the top. I actually really like that. And this is what it looks like inside on the actual tab pages. That's really nice. How much is it? 13. I'm kind of tempted by that. I'm going to think about that. Got a nice little set of small world bookmarks. I feel like Catherine would love these. And they do have this notebook as well. Oh, I like this cuz this has got sections. Why do I love stationery so much? I love a notebook with sections. That one is 16. That's a nice puzzle with all of the characters on the band stand with the castle in the background. I think this is a poncho. Oh, no. It's a bag. Oh, it's a bag. Oh, it's a bag. It says adult, so I assumed it was a poncho, but it's not. It's this bag. Look at Eeyore. Eeyore is so cute. He looks so He looks very squidgy. I'm really sorry, but I've met somebody else. See you later. I'll insert a picture of Paul in the supermarket the other day at the shopping center. I think the Mickey that you picked up might have been even bigger than that. Yeah, we've seen loads of people in those. Paul's got his eye on this spirit jersey. I already had this because Disney Parks actually sent it to me when they were promoting Disneyland Paris at Christmas. So Paul's thinking about getting a matching one. Oh, Mickey looks a little um angry there. He does. I got my notebook and because they'd run out of regular bags, we were able to buy this rucksack one for €5 and we thought we'd go for that cuz the they only had one giant carrier bag left and it was €4 just for a carrier bag. So, we figured this is a better deal. That's really nice, actually. I like that. That'd be good for swimming stuff. We're just heading back towards the castle, as you can see here. We're hoping before the live stream, there's quickly time to go and look at the dragon cuz that was one thing that we really wanted to do today. This castle is so pretty, isn't it? Yeah, look at this. That is beautiful. You can really see the detail of inside of this castle. It's so nice that you can actually go inside unlike a Disney World. Other than if you're eating at Cinderella's Raw Table, of course. I think we're on the right track going this way. Just have to show you this store as we're going past. Look how cute this is. Anyway, we need to go and find the dragon. Well, this view of the castle is pretty spectacular as we're walking out. Look at that. Looking very blue here. Looking up at the castle. I'm going to leave the vlog here just for a minute while I do the live stream. And then next time you see us, we'll probably be I don't know, somewhere around Main Street, I would imagine. So, we'll see you shortly. Look what's happened. How? I don't know how that happened. I haven't even taken my ears off, so that's even weirder. We had a little bit of a live stream fail. Unfortunately, it for one thing was too dark. So, we are going to have to do the live stream tomorrow for the Patreon members over in the other park, but during the daytime cuz you just can't see anything. And also, the signal wasn't good enough either. So, we'll have to stay outside. We tried to go inside the castle and it just cut out on the Wi-Fi. So, we will do that tomorrow instead. Just passing through this Agrabar area. here. I love this. And just over here is a little exhibition. I remember Becky and I going in there because we were so cold and the heating was on in there. We were just absolutely living the dream. So, we spent ages in there. That there looks absolutely It really does. Stunning. This is beautiful. Oh my goodness. And like I said, we will be back in a couple of days and we'll show all of this. We'll show the nighttime um fireworks show. I think there may be drones. I don't know if I've got that wrong. Now, we're going to head out, I think, because we're quite tired, aren't we? I want to stay and look at the tree. Paul just wants to stay here all night. But it's okay. We are coming back. But we are going to go this way. Let's go through this arcade bit. So down here, Discovery Arcade. You can feel the heat just as you stand here. Yeah. The heating is on in here. And like I said, me and Becky, this was a lifesaver. When we were here in January 2019, it was snowing. It was actually snowing. Our Euro Star got cancelled. And we discovered this bit. And you can just hang out in here cuz it's nice and warm. There's a few benches along, but how pretty is this? I think the bake shop you can access from both sides. A Christmas vibe here today has just been absolutely brilliant and exactly what we were hoping for. I thought you doctor, they've got the voices coming from the top windows like they have in the Magic Kingdom. In this case, I think it's a dentist and maybe a doctor's surgery rather than a music lesson like they have in Disney World. I just love all the detail though. Last look for tonight. But don't worry, we'll be back in a couple of days. In a couple of days when we're saying goodbye, that'll be sad because it will be the last time. But we're not going to think about that right now. I don't even want to go back to the hotel room tonight. Paul just wants to sleep under this tree, but we really can't do that. It's kind of cold. I will just never get over how beautiful this hotel is and the fact that it's right in the park. It is amazing. It's so stunning. They have royal themed rooms, like princess themed rooms. And if you're in any of the ones that face this way, you would actually see into the park. And this is where you get the bus from. So you go past the Walt Disney Studios park, keep going out the main exit to the right to these bus stops. It's like two rows. And we come down to the end for the Adagio Saras. So this just shows the hotel's Saras is us. We are now walking because the bus I think was going to be 20 minutes to wait until it comes and the walk was 15. So, by my maths, there is no point waiting 20 minutes for a bus when you could have walked it quicker. And here it is. That was so quick. That actually didn't even feel like 15 minutes to me. Good morning, everyone. As you can see, it's the next day. We kind of did that usual fail of being so tired towards the end of the day. We were going to wrap up when we got back, but we were very tired cuz we walked. We were so tired. Yeah. I think cuz we did that walk at the end that kind of finished us off. But we just wanted to end this vlog and say what an incredible day it was yesterday, wasn't it? It was. It's got Christmas written all over it. Yeah. The Christmas stuff was just like the atmosphere when we walked in and you had Mickey in his Christmas the outfit. There was snow on Main Street as we walked up. The music was incredible. The parade, it really did just have the most amazing Christmas feel to the whole park. Um, but just experiencing the attractions as well. I'm so glad that Paul got to experience Big Thunder Mountain cuz that was closed. That was epic. Yeah, when we were in Florida, he hasn't even done the Florida one, so that was great. Um, one of the highlights definitely for me was the snow on Main Street walking in. That was probably like the biggest thing for me. What was your highlight? To be fair, that was up there. That was I want to say it's about the second. The first, believe it or not, I'm going to sound a little bit corny now. When you see the floats going by, you know, to me, Christmas is all about the little ones and seeing them enjoy themselves and stuff like even all the adults. We were all having an amazing time watching the parade. So to me, the parade so far is what is is literally the biggest highlight so far. Absolutely. Like the parades here at Disneyland Paris as well, I love the music, but I love the way that they do the parade. So it kind of comes around. All of the kind of floats stop and some of the characters get off and then start walking and others get on. It's kind of weird. It's almost like a little performance. It doesn't just go by like they normally do. In like the central island Yeah. Yeah. So, it's just a little bit different, but the parades here are great. I do remember that from previous trips. And yeah, you're right. The Christmas one, seeing all of the families and like Paul said, the children just enjoying it so much and like shouting for the characters and stuff. It's just really cute, isn't it? Yeah, it was amazing. Anybody at any age, no matter who you are or where you're from, I'm sure that if you watch it, you will truly appreciate it. Oh, yeah. Anyone of any age could love that parade. And if you love Christmas, it's just absolutely perfect. So, we And I love Christmas. So, it was perfect. Yet, you don't want the Christmas tree up as soon as we get home. What's that about? No. Well, I love Christmas, so don't think anything negative of this. I just don't understand trees in living rooms. So, hang on a second. Are you saying you don't like the tree at all? But anyway, we can debate this all day long. I'm going to put up a poll on Instagram and see what you guys think about when you can put your Christmas tree up. Vote for me. No. But thank you guys so much for watching this. I hope you enjoyed it. It's been a while since I've been to Disneyland Paris and obviously Paul's first time. So, if you did enjoy it, please do give it a thumbs up. And we've got lots more to come. We're just about to head off to the other park, the Walt Disney Studios Park, which I think is getting a new name fairly shortly. And it's going to be having massive changes next year. So, the World of Frozen will be opening up. That is going to be huge for that park, and I can't wait to see that. We'll definitely be back to cover that next year. Um, but if you've not already subscribed, please do because we do have those other vlogs coming up and we're going to try and fit in as much as we can over the next few days. So, subscribe and tap the bell icon if you want to see all of that as well as more Disneyland Paris next year and Disney World cuz I'll be back in Disney World in January. So, thank you so much for watching. Hope you're having a great day and we'll see you next week for Walt Disney Studios Park. Bye bye. You got to tell people how you like it as an impression of who you're actually eating. Oh, I'm no good at impressions. I'll I'll I'll You can give it a go. Try give it a go. [Music] [Music]"

      "transcript": "We just spent the entire day at the Festival of the Holidays in Epcot. And this might just be the best festival. Cookies, joy, cheer, and every single holiday tradition. Festival of the holidays 2025. We came. We saw we rested. Did we have fun? We milkd this this morning and accidentally took a photo. It was on photo mode. Back to the morning. The Epcot International Festival of the Holidays runs November 28th through December 30th. It's a global celebration of the holiday season where you can eat your way through almost 20 holiday kitchens and hear their stories from international storytellers. The main event is the food and most of the holiday kitchens open at 11:00. This is the coziest festival Epcot does. So, if you want the one that actually feels like the season, this is it. There's a cookie stroll where you can get a free prize if you eat enough cookies. I mean, who's mad at that? Stick around to see what the prize is this year. And if you're wondering where Quincy is, she abandoned us and went to New York City with her family. Hi Quincy. Hope you're having a great time. Hello from Bryant Park Holiday Market where I am eating raw buns and dumplings. It's like festival of the holidays, but somehow the food here is a lot more expensive. The very first thing you want to do when you arrive at the festival is pick up a holiday passport. It's this pocket-sized guide to everything that's here, and you'll be checking it constantly so you don't miss anything. All right, ready to go. Rope dropping at opening day of a festival in Epcot means different things for different people. It's currently 8:31 a.m. So over here, all of the early entry guests are just being let into the park. And this is as far as we are getting at 8:30. But on this particular morning, it's actually cold enough. currently 49° that a lot of people are coming inside and going to Connections Cafe to get a Starbucks drink or just hang out in some of the seating in here and they don't mind that they might lose their place in line. Wow, people are not roped dropping merch for Festival of the Holidays. Amazing. But I do see two eager guests who are roped dropping the merchandise for Festival of the Holidays this morning. Oh, three. Three. Okay, you all just ended up here. [Music] Now, pins are also available for this festival, but you will not find them in Creation Shop, at least not here on day one of the festival. You're actually going to want to head to the bridge for those. And they are very, very limited edition. Okay, just so we all remember what the real thing looks like, and then turn around. Communicore Hall Festival of the Holidays 2025. [Music] The doors magically open. And there it is, the gingerbread spaceship Earth. This is about to do a show for us in 35 seconds. Let's get ready. Not only can you see the gingerbread spaceship Earth and Communicore Hall during Festival of the holidays, you can now also meet Santa Claus. He's here till Christmas Eve because of course he has a lot of work to do after that. But you can continue meeting Santa Goofy over at Odyssey until the end of the festival. [Music] I was just leaving Communicore Hall and who did I run into? But Miranda and she is in the midst of her Olaf's holiday tradition expedition. Don't look. She's already completed some and we don't want any more spoilers than the one that we're going to find together on camera right now. This is a really fun scavenger hunt. This one is such a great way to learn about holidays around the world. Uh you can see you pay $11.99 for this. It comes with these stickers and then you find the uh the Olaf in its location on the map and then you put the sticker there and when you complete it, you get a prize. Should we go find this one right now? Let's do it. Do you have any leads? I think so. There's one here at Communicore Hall, which is kind of why you found me wandering our Okay. Are you feeling like you know where? I think we found one. You found one? I think so. Look up. Oh my gosh, there's Olaf. I'm on a journey to find my friend Kendall and rope drop the Odyssey. Wow, you have so many things that I'm going to support you through consuming. Well, you have a a plant-based cookie you get to try. I do. I do. And it's covered in glitter. All right. What are you starting with? The red velvet camel crop. That green color reminds me of like vintage green. A vintage Christmas. This It's a apple caramel cupcake. It's like a coffee cake. Dan, I'm looking forward to it. Are you interested in glittering magical cookies? Can I show how? Oh, there you can see it. I think this is a vegan cookie for you. All right. Oh, dude. So, it's kind of giving granola bar with glitter. This is the BRL winter biner. It is really good. I truthfully am not a huge cider beer person, but this is really good. Um, IPAs are traditionally uh a lot bitter, a lot darker, a lot a lot of a stronger flavor. And if you're an IPA drinker, you are an IPA drinker and you love this stuff. This is going to be yours. That's having a hard cider Christmas. Oh, that's nice. Humid. My first booth of the day. Of course, we're starting straight off with sweets. We are at this world showcase. We're going through twice. First, we grabbed the liquid nitrogen chocolate pepper mousse. It doesn't look the most appealing, I will be honest. But I have faith. I have faith. I also expected like a big show, like the liquid nitrogen of it all. They didn't really give that. Cheers. Okay, Squirrel Showcase. I was going to get actually Emma L is here with me as well. I'm going to make her be in the video. She tried to run. Um, we were going to get one of the floats there as well. They don't have all of the things they need to make it today. That might not be true tomorrow or when you're here, but that's true for us. So, the liquid nitrogen, I think last year's was more exciting, more fun. This one was a little bit more creamy. It did not have that hard shell that you kind of expect with liquid nitro liquid nitrogen, but I love a peppermint chocolatey flavor. It was creamy. It was simple and it was comforting. I would not say it's something to go out of your way for. I love that I'm starting out the day with a cookie. This is the holiday sugar cookie from Connections Cafe, aka the Starbucks location in Epcot. This is your basic sugar cookie with some fun holiday sprinkles on it. Is this just a classic sugar cookie? Yes. Is it anything special? Not necessarily. But it's a darn good sugar cookie. So, if you're looking for a super simple dessert, or maybe your kiddos are super picky, but they want something fun, I highly recommend. Okay, it's time to get in line for our first booth of the day, or at least mine, uh, which will be the American Holiday Table. Now, this has been a returning Best of the Fest for us. It's had some phenomenal menu items in the past, and I'm seeing a few familiars here already, which makes me really excited for this one to be open. Apparently, I liked Thanksgiving meals so much yesterday, I've decided to continue it on for today as my very first booth. This is the slow roasted turkey made with stuffing, mashed potatoes, green beans, and cranberry sauce. We've also picked up the blackened catfish, which I know is my favorite already. Um, this is made with hop and John and comeback sauce. And then the chocolate cookie featuring Snickers bar pieces and salted caramel. It's actually another one of my favorites and it's actually one of the cookies that is intended to be for the cookie stroll. And then right here in the back, we did pick up the beer flight. This is made up of three different beers. So you've got the Crooked Can Brewing Company BA Hotbug IPA, uh, the $3 Brewing Eggnog White Porter, and the Victory Brewing Company chocolate cherry stell. So, I know we have a couple of things that are returning for the festival this year, including the turkey and stuffing, the blackened catfish, and the um Snickers cookie. And while they've changed this a little bit, it's so so good. It's very gooey. It's very runny. Um the caramel though stays together so nicely. I'm definitely recommending it. Same thing with the turkey. It's like having Thanksgiving dinner all over again. Black and catfish is my all-time favorite here. It's perfectly seasoned. Uh, it's got kind of those hopping John sauce to it and I I love the beans and the rice. It's got like a nice Cajun kick to it. Of the three flights, ironically, I think I liked the eggnog white porter the best. They were not bad. Um, but I liked that one and surprisingly the chocolate cherry stout. And I'm not typically one that really likes stout beers, but this one really impressed me. So, overall, I think this is definitely one of the places you need to stop on your next festival visit. Check out this year's festival gift card. Yep, it's a wearable like usual. This year it's a snow globe and it has Mickey and Minnie. These can be purchased all over or I should say these can be loaded with cash at retail locations all over Epcot. It's a minimum of $15 you have to load onto here, but you get to spend all of that money. None of it goes towards a purchase. And once again, you get to wear this all around Epcot to all the booths. And all you have to do is hand them your wrist and this little dangle barcode comes out. And before you know it, you've paid for your festival food or merchandise or anything that you want to buy while you're here in Epcot. It's not only festival exclusive items that you can purchase with with this. You can purchase anything in Walt Disney World. Let's talk about some of the additional festival offerings during this festival of the holidays. Glimmering green Houses is a really cool overlay that they do over at Living with the Land, especially when it gets dark outside. The ride that we know and love becomes completely illuminated with beautiful holiday lights. It's a very festive experience, even if you just ride the ride. But there's more. Their iconic behind the scenes tour also offers a holiday glimmering green houses version that happens after dark. This isn't usually the case with this tour. It's usually during the day, but this gives you the opportunity to walk around literally backstage on the ride itself and see all of these beautiful lights, the topiaries, all of their amazing growing techniques. everything that you see on the Living with the Land ride. You get to walk around up close and personal and experience firsthand. We are here for our next holiday kitchen. Our first real full one. It's the Las Posas holiday kitchen. And of course, we grabbed it all. So, we're grabbing the tostada de carne, the tamale de polo kmul, which I'm sorry I'm butching these. I'm doing my best. And the doulsece jal leche churro. We also are trying out the Chime Amazing Margarita and the horada margarita. So, let's dive in. Okay, we're taking full bites. Starting with the Doulce dele. [Music] I took too big of a bite. Tostada or try a margarita. Chazing margarita. This booth is a hit every year. This year is no different. A few of the standouts are the tostada de carne. Oh my gosh, this is easily my favorite thing here at the booth. It was the brazed beef tips um with fried corn tor on a fried corn tortilla with black beans, crispy onions. It was perfection. And also, you did not even notice that the beef was a little bit overcooked until you ate a piece separately from the entire dish. The black beans really helped make it a little bit more moist. The tostada never got soggy. I'm I'm ranting and raving about this because I absolutely loved it. The tamale would be a skip for me. I just think it's there are better options. It was not my favorite. I will leave it a sec. The dulce de leche churro was another major highlight. I loved it. Disney World churros are often hit or miss unless you're at Nomad Lounge. This one was delicious. There was a perfect amount of filling. It was not overwhelming. The churo itself was really nice and crispy and sweet thanks to the cinnamon and the sugar, but it wasn't stale, which is what you typically find with a lot of Disney churros. Of the two drinks, my personal favorite was the Chime Amazing Margarita. It was not overly alcohol forward, which a lot of people like, and some people feel like they're missing something if that's the case. This one was nice and sweet. It had that apple ginger sweetness that kind of made it a little bit more sippable. It was a little bit more easy to enjoy. Definitely my favorite drink of the two that I tried. Overall, this one is going to be a magic with a capital M kind of booth for me. I'm at my next booth, which is the favorites of Festival Pass, which is located right in Unicorn Plaza. I'm sure you can hear the music. This is kind of like your hub. I'm really excited for these Reuben Crocketts. I already ate some. I have my little passport. And they are made with pastrami, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and thousand island dipping sauce. Exactly how a Reuben should be. And let me tell y'all, these taste exactly like a Reubin sandwich. Let me show you. It's so good. I believe they were best of the festival last year for us. And so, I'm definitely putting on my list for this year. Now I have the Panaton holiday trifle. This is made with the eggnog custard topped with a cranberry cherry compost and sugared almonds. Look at that bad boy. It's a trifle, so you're going to get all those different layers. The bottom has that eggnog custard. It's a little thicker cuz it is a custard. I really like this pecan pie hard cider. I don't know if that could live up to the hype. This tastes like pecan pie. It's very smooth. Um, they're not overly carbonated, which I really like. And it tastes like you just ate cotton pie. This is a Cigar City Brewing oatmeal raisin. That is so wild. You can taste it like right in the back of like a nice chewy oatmeal cookie. Tiramisu imperial stout. You can taste the coffee like right at the end. It's not like piggy in the mouth. I just drink a cup of coffee. It's just it's there. It's like I think I'm starting to really like all these beers, especially at Epcot, because they're just a little different. They're just a little out there. And again, Rubic Croquettes, y'all. From the funnel cake stand, we picked up the red velvet cookie funnel cake. Now, this is the festival exclusive funnel cake. It's topped with powdered sugar, vanilla ice cream, cream cheese, whipped cream, red velvet cookie pieces, mini chocolate chips, and chocolate syrup. Here we go. This might be my favorite festival funnel cake yet. I love those red velvet cake pieces. They're almost like cookies cuz they're like dried out a little bit. The chocolate chips are very nice and miniature chocolate drizzle is great. But that cream cheese whipped cream against the vanilla icing is just chef's kiss. If you're going to get a funnel cake at all at Disney World, definitely recommend this one this season. I'm back at Chestnuts and Good Cheer. This is the location that you want to go to if you enjoy chestnuts roasting on an open fire. Fire roasted chestnuts. They actually roast them outside here every day. You can also get a selection of cinnamon glazed nuts. Today we are going to be reviewing the almonds and the pecans. Spoiler alert, these are two of my favorite snacks in Walt Disney World, so this is kind of not fair. I'm starting with the almonds. They have a crunch on the outside. very much a cinnamon glazed sugary sugar glazed experience. You can get these all over Walt Disney World. So, it's not that these items are necessarily unique to this festival. Actually, the cinnamon glazed cashews aren't something you can normally find in Disney World. That is something exclusive to this booth in this festival. Cinnamon glazed pecans. It's kind of like getting a pecan pie in a little bag that has purple hearts all over it. Need I say more? We have Connections Eery, which has two specialty offerings for the festival. I'm waiting for my mobile order now, but we've got the Figment Holiday Sweater Lege Waffle for $4.99 and the spiced caramel apple. We highly do recommend mobile ordering at this spot pretty much always because it can save you some real time. Um, and who wants to wait in a big line? You're already going to wait in a lot of big lines throughout the day. Might as well make it one less. First we have the Figment Holiday Sweater Lee Waffle. This is a chocolatecoated gingerbread waffle with a flurry of blizzard themed sprinkles and white chocolate garnish. And then we have the spiced caramel apple. So this is minute-made cranberry juice, apple cider, and caramel syrup garnished with a cinnamon stick. [Music] I don't know. I do taste a little bit of gingerbread in the leash waffle, but honestly, the waffle is just nearly stale. It's ju it's not worth the money. I know it's super cute. It's great to take pictures with. It doesn't melt as quickly now that it's not blazing hot in Florida, but it's just if you're looking for something gingerbread, I think you will be disappointed. The spiced caramel apple really surprised me. The apple cider flavor comes through really nicely, but it's not overpowering. as well as the caramel. This tastes like the holidays, especially this festival. You want to take advantage of all of the entertainment and the interesting and unique offerings that come with this festival. These are the things that make the festivals more than just booth hopping. Make sure you see Figment in his holiday sweater over at Journey into Imagination. Of course, Joyful over in Communicore Plaza. This is my favorite music offering during the Festival of the Holidays. But don't discount Voices of Liberty over in the American Adventure Pavilion because they are spectacular. One of the best vocal groups I think in the whole world. My next booth here in Germany at the Bavaria Holiday Kitchen. This one is kind of hit or miss for me personally. Here's what we're chowing down on. Of course, we grabbed the returning pork schnitle, the cheese fondue, and the hazelnut liner cookie. We also wanted to try a few of the beers. Two of them are new, one is returning, so we went ahead and grabbed the beer flight. I love this booth. This booth is going to offer something that a lot of people are going to find familiar with the flavors, but might be a little bit more adventurous than what you're necessarily used to at home. The Schnitle is my favorite. It is an absolute standout. It is returning and it is one that I think deserves to be returning every year. The mushroom sauce on top is delicious. I'm a mushroom fan. I love the earthy creaminess of it. It also has a really special umami flavor. The cheese fondue I love. It's cheese, it's bread, and its vegetables. The vegetables are cooked to perfection in my opinion. They're nice and soft, super easy to enjoy, but they're not mush, which is very important. The cheese is creamy, savory, and just overall very comforting, very familiar. It's not too sharp. It's not too pungent. So, it it's a crowdleaser of the beer flight. I'm not a logger girl. I'm not going to give notes on it because it's just dark, hoppy, and a little smoky. And that's about all I can say. It's not my favorite. I don't like a dark beer, but if that's what you're looking for, this one is probably going to add something that's really robust and interesting. I loved the cider. It almost reminded me of mscato or a relingling in a way. It was really nice and light. There is a reasoning at this booth if you'd rather have wine, but this was easy, sippable, and just delicious magic. My next adventure is taking me over to another staple here in the World Showcase. Inside the Morocco Pavilion, you can typically find the Tangerine Cafe open pretty much year round. However, here for the festival, they do tend to change the menu slightly. You're probably going to notice right off the bat, there's two Moroccan wraps here. Miranda, why did you get two Moroccan wraps? Well, for good reason. First one over here is the uh turola chicken. The other one over to the left is the falafel, which is actually the plant-based option. Then we also have the stone baked Moroccan bread with the assorted dips, which are my personal favorite uh for this time of the year. The cider flight here covers three different cers. And then right over here in this tall glass, we got the sparkling holiday fig cocktail. You can't ever go wrong with breads and dips. I think it's like a chimmy cherry chamoa sauce. fantastic. The hummus is great. The other one's a little spicy, but that's pretty typical for this particular location. Um, and then the bread here is typically more like inflated and very big. This one had more of like a pa bread consistency to me. Fantastic. I really loved it. Let's talk about the uh holiday fig. Oh my goodness. I've heard people talking about this one. I didn't believe it until I actually had it. This is incredible. It's got that notes of a holiday cranberry, but almost wants to be a champagne cider taste to it with that wine. Oh my goodness. The falafel was great. I really enjoyed it. It had some nice um low heat spices to it. Uh it had more of like a cornbread consistency as it kind of crumbled in your mouth. The chimola chicken was worth the wait. We had to wait on that one for a little bit cuz they were still cooking it. The sauce that they use on it is perfection. It's just enough heat to really give it the extra flavor without going too overboard. Let's talk about the Cider Flight. Now, my favorite was the $3 Brewing Golden Fig hard cider. This one was so so light, so airy. It very much tastes like a golden cider. The one that in the center, the Gulfream Brewing Holiday Snake Bite. This one almost had like a cinnamony taste to it. Um, it's not bad, but it's not my favorite. It's really, really good, but it's kind of strange. And then the third one here is the Keel Farms Frostbite blueberry ginger hard cider. The blueberry and the ginger pair perfectly together. That's exactly what you're going to taste as soon as you start sipping it, and you won't want to stop. It's very much a holiday flavor that I don't think I've ever had before, which kept it really interesting for me. So, I really like the changes in this booth this year. All right, we just came from experimental prototype cookies of tomorrow or a little little play on Epcot today. Um, that is going to be inside Communicore Hall. It's going to be inside where you see the Gingerbread Spaceship Earth, as well as you can meet Santa. It's all in one place, so it's a little busy in there. The line was long, but you can find like three different cookies here, which is a good stop for me. Starting us off nice and simple. Joffrey's hot chocolate. You can also get this with vodka. Today, we just opted with traditional Joffrey's hot chocolate. It is super creamy. It is chocolatey. It is light. It has marshmallows on it and whipped cream. We got the salted caramel spaceship earth cookie. If you love sugar cookies, go ahead and add this to your list. Basically, two sugar cookies. Some icing and sprinkles, but that layer of salted caramel. There's not an insane amount of salted caramel. Personally, I could have gone for more, but I also have a passion for salted caramel, but you can still kind of see it a little bit. We also got the ginger molasses cookie, which has cream cheese icing on top. Do you see how thick that layer of icing is? I like it. This is good. And this is good cream cheese icing. It's not grainy. It is so smooth. Oh, both of these cookies are available on the cookie straw. I already have three. There's also another cookie at Experimental Prototype cookies of tomorrow. Gosh, that was a mouthful. They were just out right now, but that also got you another stamp. There are a lot of cookie options this year, and we're slowly marking them all up. Of course, I also had to get the beer flight. We are going to start with the Evanho Park Brewing Company frosted gingerbread white stout. It's sweet. Tastes baked. Like I don't think I would have guessed gingerbread if I did this blindfolded. Then you get the bitter bubbles in the front. Just that little bit of sweetness. It's I've been really impressed with the beers today. Our second one is the Gulf Stream Brewing Baking Spirits Bright Gingerbread Red Ale. Again, I don't want to say distinctly gingerbread. I'll say it tastes baked. It tastes sweet. This one's a little bit more carbonated on your tongue a little more on the front of your lips a little more. Crooked can brewing company gingerbread bok. This one's not as sweet as the others. This one tastes a lot more like normal plain beer to me. I think this combines really well with the molasses cookie. Like I just want to go back and forth and like gobble up this drink and the molasses cookie together. This is a hit for me, too. I have been getting some really good boots this year. There's something very special happening in the Odyssey Pavilion. Last year, you could meet Santa here. This year, it's not Santa, but there is someone else. Should be in here. Nothing's better than being told you're going to meet Goofy for work, right? Like, this is awesome. My next assignment is with JP, and I just heard that she is next in line to meet Santa Goofy. And I think we may be catching her walking in right now. There she is. Hi, Goofy. How are you? So good to see you. You look so great in your get up. I know. It looks so good. Looks so good. Oh, thank you. Oh my goodness. And your sleigh looks fantastic. It looks so good. Oh, thank you. Yes, we're matching. I love it. I love it. JP, hi. You just met Santa Goofy. We did. It was so much fun. So, it looks really magical. You got to sit in his sleigh. For a moment, I thought you might be taken away on a on a journey. He was like, \"No, I'm just kidding.\" He's like, \"We have to just deliver a couple uh gifts. Do you have a minute?\" And I'm like, \"Oh, man. We were going to go review a food booth together.\" Darn. We are here at the Tuscany holiday kitchen and we're getting two of the food items and one of the beverages which is returning but not from Tuscini. It's from a different booth. Okay, another pronunciation warning incoming. This here in the front is the pizza e chocolato. We have the salicha e pepperoni and then in the back we have the tiramisu stout which previously was at a different booth. So it's kind of interesting that it's popping up here at Festival of the Holidays. I'm actually surprised by how much I love the stout. That's going to be my favorite thing at this booth, crazy enough. Maybe not crazy. This one is kind of infamous when it comes to Epcot festivals. The stout is actually really nice. It's really light, really, really drinkable, on the sweeter side. I wouldn't say you're getting any tiramisu flavors, per se, but it's really, really nice and super easy to just sip on and enjoy. It's nothing too heavy and nothing that's going to weigh you down. The chocolot. This has the potential to be really nice. The bites are too big. The dough is not cooked all the way through, making it really, really just chewy. It's sweet. It's sugar. Kids are going to enjoy this. It's going to be a nice simple bite. I think that it's just not cooked through. Finally, the last one. The sausage is good. It has really nice flavors. There's a really nice snap to it when you bite in it. The bites are pretty big, so definitely grab a knife. I did not. I also love peppers and onions cooked. That is one of my favorite things. I love the earthiness of a good vegetable. Just makes me feel nice and healthy. Um, and then the bread. The bread was very underwhelming. It did have some herbs in it which were pretty apparent, but overall it was kind of dry. There's better Italian food at the restaurants in the back and there's better small bites around the rest of the festival. So, this one unfortunately is going to be a tragic but little tea. It's not terrible. It's just not good. Oh my goodness. They weren't kidding. There is a line over here at Lheim. Lheim was good to us. Now we've got the pastrami on rye. This is made with housemade pickles and deli mustard. It is a returning favorite of ours and you can grab one for $6. The smoked salmon potato lattka is also another returning favorite of ours for $6.25 is what you can pick it up at. Um Mickeyshaped almond black and white cookie. Now this one's new. It also is part of the new cookie stroll cookies. Uh you can grab one for $4. And the Rugok is a pastry with raspberry jam, walnuts, and cinnamon. Again, this is a returning favorite of ours. Um, it is also a cookie stroke item as well. You can grab one for $4.25. And then turning to the drinks, the Brooklyn Brewery black chocolate stout. This is a 6 oz for $6, but you can get a 12 oz for $9.75 and the frozen New York whiskey sour. Okay, let's talk about Lheime for a second. The standouts here were definitely the whiskey sour and the rugla, which is the pastry with like the raspberry all around it. Oh my gosh, so good. The black and white Mickey almond cookie tastes phenomenal. A little bit more than just a regular sugar cookie, right? So, it's a little bit more jazzed up than what you might think. That pastrami on rye is so crisp on the outside. That deli mustard on the inside is just so sharp and pungent almost. uh along with the extra pickle on the top. It's just like extra briny almost. Oh, so good. But the flavors work so well together. And then the salmon laka. Oh my gosh, don't get me started. I love that thing. I think I could eat the regular potato lockas, but when I really want an extra treat, that extra salmon on top and they've got a really generous portion for the cost is incredible. It's got a couple of like red onions, regular onions, I think some like micro greens on the top. So, so good. I highly recommend it. I can see now why everybody is raving about this particular holiday kitchen. I'm going to review a booth that might confuse you a little bit because it's kind of hard to find in the passport. Block and Hans is a place that you can visit year round regardless of whether there is a festival or not or regardless of what festival is currently running. They're on their own special page called festival exclusive offerings. So Block and Hans right now is featuring their own cinnamon glaze nuts. Turns out these are made by them. These are in-house special a completely different recipe as told to me by the cast members. The other offering is called the apple pie frozen slush. This can be served with or without alcohol. You can tell by the characters on the cup. This one is alcohol-f free. Let's give the block and Han cinnamon glazed nuts a try. On first bite, it tastes exactly the same. It's almost like they just added vanilla to the original recipe. There is a little something more there in terms of flavor, but not a lot. I won't call it an upgrade because I like both a lot. This does taste really good, but it's a cool alternative to something that I eat in Disney World all the time. Apple pie frozen slush, [Music] like a frozen hot cider. Cuz this year everybody's they're all over Disney World, they have Joffrey's frozen cocoa. So, it's kind of like that with like a mold cider. Um, it's very delicious. I don't know why they don't offer the uh frozen apple juice more places. I think it's to make it feel exclusive. Come for the uh frozen apple pie slush. Stay for the unique cinnamon glazed nuts. Maybe I mean that the other way around. Uh they're both good. I am here at Shanghai in the China pavilion for three different eats. So, first of all, we have the barbecue shasu pork fried rice with Chinese lashang sausage, egg, yellow onion, green onion, and sesame. Then I have the vegetable spring rolls with citrus sauce. And finally, the tiger milk tea with asam black tea, whole milk, brown sugar syrup, and tapioca boba. I have never had boba before. I'm going to be careful with what I say about the boba because I have learned that I think boba just personally isn't my thing because of the texture of the actual boba. Um the flavor I wasn't getting a lot of flavor from the actual boba pearls though. So I don't think that's just a me thing. I think that's it could have a little bit more flavor in general. Um as for the tea itself, the black tea certainly does come through the uh charu pork. I really love the flavor of this. I do feel that potentially the rice maybe was just a little bit overcooked. Just a little bit. The sauce that's on here is fantastic. Love, love the flavor of that. And the vegetable spring rolls I loved. Now listen, I know they're spring rolls. Probably you're very familiar with them, but they're so good. I love the flavor of them and the citrus sauce on them. Fantastic. I'm standing in Morocco, but I'm actually testing out the Shiwasu Holiday Kitchen because the drummers are practicing right now. when they're out practicing, they're performing. Um, in the Japan pavilion and if you guys watched our last festival video, I had I tried to talk over them and that was a mistake. So, we're going to, you know, learn from our mistakes and we're just going to talk about it here in Morocco, but it's actually in Japan. I love this booth. I am biased. The sushi tree really is just a cold crab rangu with a little less crunch. I love it nonetheless. I think it's a really safe way to start trying sushi for the first time. There's nothing uncooked in it. The spice is not true spice. It's really more of um a flavor element rather than a physical one. And actually really loved the addition of the rice pearls made it nice and crunchy. The soba, I love the soba as well. It's great on cold days especially. The dashi is what makes it so special. It has a really nice savory umami flavor. It's nice and salty. It is fishbased, but it's not overly fishy. And then it's noodles and fried shrimp, which is just delicious. The drink was fine. It was sweet. It was kitty. Um, it's not one that I would get all the time, but it's light and something that kids might really enjoy, especially the strawberry bun. Oh my gosh. Last thing, strawberry bun blew me away. It was so good. It was like the um it was like strawberry milk tea or just like strawberry milk. I'm very biased. That's one of my favorite things in the world. It was nice, sweet, light, and airy. Overall, love this booth, but also these are flavors that I feel like are chosen for me personally. So, at Meliki Vodka Holiday Kitchen, this reminds me of what I would have at Thanksgiving or Christmas of like ham and mashed potatoes, but with a twist. Obviously, it's shredded pork, and there's so much, which I just love. The sweet potatoes are super creamy. It does say it is made with coconut. I do not really find that flavor very prominent and I know coconut can be a little controversial for some people. It's not overwhelming. I can't really taste it, but I can tell you that these are super creamy and the pork is shredded and super juicy. Next, we have another IPA. This is the Maui Brewing Company mango sticky rice IPA. I think this is one of my favorite IPAs I've tried today. You get a little bit of sweetness right at the end, but not like, oh, I'm drinking a sweet beer like a chocolate beer or anything like that. We also got another cookie for our cookie stroll. This is the coffee mocha cookie topped with coffee infused buttercream, cocoa nibs, and chocolate covered espresso beans. I love how light and fluffy the buttercream is. It's definitely a whipped buttercream and it does taste like coffee. It's a coffee cookie, but it's not overwhelming. It's not too strong. I have been very impressed with the cookies today and they keep getting better. This was best of the fest 2024 and I think it might be coming back for 2025. We've made our way to Noa Buena Casino Coina. This is giving us a bit of a taste of Brazil during the holidays. Love. And I love that too. And there's a really exciting plant-based entree that I get to experience. Woohoo. What are you starting with? Pande hamone, which is traditional Latin Christmas bread, rolled ham, raisins, and green olives. So, this is the ponche uh navado, which is Christmas punch with apples, pears, guava, oranges, dried hibiscus, brown sugar, tamarind, cinnamon sticks, and cloves. Wow. And it is non-alcoholic, so that's a win for me. Oh, that sounds delicious. Yeah. And my last thing is a cinnamon spiced chocolate crinkle cookie. I'll be having the plant-based choriza tamale with plant-based kohita and spicy red chili sauce. That's great. [Music] M. That is not nearly as potent as I thought it would be. I've never had an olive. You've never had an olive? No. Oh, there's the center of it. There we go. I'm out it. This is the content we're bringing you. You used to think olives were going to be freaky. Mhm. Cuz they look like aliens pods. They really do. I like that. It is very fruity. Oh yeah. M. Soft cookie. I envy you so much. This is so good. I can't believe how delicious this is. And I don't know what's traditional in Brazil, but the um the texture of this is a lot Oh, no. I'm sorry. My napkin just flew at you. This is going really well. I got to say this, the star of it is this red sauce. Oh, yeah. That is spicy. So, if you have a sensitivity to spices, this is not the dish for you. There are tons of different entertainment offerings, but the holiday storytellers are different entertainment options that you can find in each pavilion that kind of give you the story of that country's holiday traditions and their origins. So, for example, in Canada, it's the Canadian holiday voyagers, and they talk about different customs of different regions around Canada. In France, it's Pierre Noel, who helps you rediscover the magic of Christmas through the letter of a delightful child, which is very sweet. And it's just things like that. Labafana is in Italy, and she is the kind-hearted witch who actually visits sleeping young children on the eve of the Epiphany. So, lots of fun stuff. There's actually one happening right now, and I definitely think you should check them out and explore. We've got La Mstead Noel the holiday kitchen which is typically one that Quincy comes and visits and I am very honored to be able to carry on that tradition. Just look at all this really good food. The roasted turkey with mushrooms, pearl onions, bacon, turkey gravy, and roasted sweet potatoes. The smoked salmon spread on a sesame bio roll with cucumber and radishes. Quincy loves this one. I'm really excited to try it. The macaron de Noel ois is the large gingerbread macaron with spiced filling. And this is new this year. The vinch uh French muled wine is flavored with orange and cinnamon spices. It's new this year, too. And then, of course, the frozen hot chocolate martini is a favorite. It's the uh vodka, cocoa, and whipped cream returning. We love this one. We know this one. All right, let's talk about it all. The turkey was not bad. I really especially love the gravy. It's almost like having its own personal stuffing to it. Um, with veggies and mushrooms and some onions. I'm not a huge fan of all the extra vegetables in it, let's say. Um, but the sauce that it creates is just enough to give it flavor without being overpowering. I'm really really glad I tried the uh bio sandwich. Um, the bio is kind of a a different color with some sesame seeds on it, but the inside with the radishes and the slices of cucumber and the salmon, very very good. There's not a whole lot of flavor to it, which is what I really like that you can kind of like pair it with the other things here at the booth. And they have plenty enough flavor to kind of carry the rest of it. The real stars of this though are that macaron. Uh, it's that gingerbread flavor, but it almost has like a spice cinnamon kind of flavor to it, too. And I love that the center has more of like a cookie consistency to it, surrounded by those little flavors of the uh icing to it. Red wine is spiced with orange and cinnamon. And it is exactly what I need. It's like a wine cider. So, if you're a fan of an apple cider, but you really want a wine version of it, this is definitely the way to go. And you can't go wrong with this frozen hot chocolate martini. It is just an alcoholic frozen hot chocolate and it is darn good and I love that whipped cream on top and I intend to drink all this. So France, you're a hard one to beat. Quincy, I'm coming for your booth. I'm at my final booth of the day for Festival of the Holidays at Yukon Holiday Kitchen. We have this beef and it has crushed potatoes. This is super salty and that's what I needed after eating like 10 cookies today. I need that kick of salt. Pretty big chunks of beef which I really appreciate. And it's shreddable with just your pork. You don't need a knife. It just kind of comes apart. The beef is so tender. For my last savory dish, I also got the seared salmon. The glaze on top I thought was going to be sweet. It's actually really salty. Butternut squash puree. It's smooth, but it's not watery. And sometimes I feel like they can borderline baby food. And this is not. It's the right consistency with the salmon. Eating it all together. It's a really good bite. We also got frozen Joffrey's coffee, which is very cold right now after my little beef bowl of stew. This kind of tastes like chocolate milk, but in like a really delicious way. Oo, look at the boat, everyone. My final cookie for the cookie stroll is our maple leaf shortbread cookie with maple buttercream. The buttercream in the middle is a little grainier than I would prefer, but it has that maple flavor. It's not overly sweet. It's very Canadian, which is why it's near here. It breaks apart fairly easily. You're not going to get a clean cut on this. So, if you're sharing, you'll want to pass it around. Who's ready to see me try my very first thing of eggnog? Now, this isn't just eggnog. This is frozen gingerbread eggnog. Here we go. Ooh. Okay. Yeah, I'm a fan. I like that. I think it's great. If you're an eggnog fan, I say absolutely give it a try. And if you're an eggnog fan, but you're nervous about gingerbread, I would still say try it because I don't think it's going to be super overpowering um to to, you know, make you dislike it. So, cheers to trying new things. Final booth. The sun is still up, which, you know, is debatable, but we're very excited about it. I'm trying out the new turkey poutine. Each year, each festival does have a different rotating poutine at the refreshment court. This one has sweet potato fries, turkey gravy, cranberry relish, and crisp onions. And then I'm also trying out a very interesting final drink. It is the Keel Farm cinnamon sugar doughnut hard cider from Plant City, Florida. A cinnamon sugar cider. This is either made for me or it's going to personally attack me. So, cheers. I think it could be a bit of both. It is super sweet, but I actually really do get that cinnamon sugar kind of sweet donuty flavor. The doughut flavor is obviously I think more of a yeast flavor than doughut per se. It is also a massive serving, which you're not, you know, it's kind of hit or miss sometimes at Epcot. Overall, it's really, really easy to sip on. It is super sweet, and I think by the time I get to the bottom of this, it'll be a little bit too sugary for me now because I've not eaten enough food. These are nice and thin, so they have a little bit more of a crisp than normally you would find at the refreshment port. Sometimes refreshment pork poutine is e either like the most delicious comforting hearty meal or it's really soggy and just not the most appetizing. I really like that these are a little bit thinner and so that way they're crispy. They can still hold up all of the topping, but they're not soaking it up and becoming soggy. The gravy is actually really surprising. It's not weighing it down like I thought it would. It's mainly on the turkey, which helps the turkey prevent being dry, and then it doesn't make everything else soggy. I don't know that I'd go out of my way to get this out of everything here. However, it is really, really good. And I think if you have several people with you and you're all wanting to eat something without spending a ton of money, this is going to be a great option. It's almost time for the first candlelight processional of 2025. Let's go experience this was December 21st, 1958 at Disneyland Park. How cool is that? The history lesson literally just happened. 1958, the very first candlelight processional in Disneyland and it opened in Disney World with Magic Kingdom in 1971 in front of Cinderella Castle. Celebrity narrators, Voices of Liberty, and a cast member choir, an incredible orchestra on stage. This is something you should not miss when you attend Festival of the Holidays here in Epcot. My last stop for the day is Holiday Sweets and Treats, which also happens to be a very special stop only because we've been working very hard at getting tons of cookies all day long. So, if you're planning on doing the holiday cookie stroll, this is exactly where you need to be after you've completed at least five of the qualifying cookies on that cookie stroll to pick up your completer prize. That's exactly what we're going to do. If you're not entirely sure which cookies qualify for the holiday cookie stroll, you can check the holiday passport in the very back of the booklet. You can see all 13, yes I said 13 cookies available this year. As you are picking them up, make sure that you pick up one of these festival passports if you haven't already. And if you don't already have one, they're at the uh cash registers. They should have extra holiday passports available for you. So you can go ahead and get your stamp. Hello. Hello. I'm going to bother you for multiple things. How are you? I'm good. I'm doing great. Thank you for I'm going to hand you this back and then I'm going to hand you the spatula and our Oh, this is so cute. Thank you so much. You're welcome. As slayigh rod plays in the background, you can see we've slayed. We've gotten all of our stamps. We turned it in. They will stamp it one final time to show that you've picked up your completer. So that way you have that. And it is presented by M&M's this year. So we got some mini M&M's. But then our big treat is this super cute little cooking spatula. It says cookie stroll 2020. Holiday cookie stroll 2025. Comes with this little card here and then as you turn it over, it's a recipe card. Oh, and it even has Epcot kind of embossed into engraved into it. So, super super cute. It's uh for peanut butter frosting and peanut butter cookies with M&M's minis milk chocolate candies holiday blend. So, if you want to be able to make your own cookies when you get home, pick up the completer. I have never been more excited than I am right now in my whole life. Maybe that's an exaggeration, but from holiday sweets and treats, you can grab a hot chocolate flight. It's completely non-alcoholic. There are three different types. We have Christmas sugar cookie hot cocoa topped with whipped cream and sprinkles. Sorry, that's this one. We have gingerbread hot cocoa topped with whipped cream and a little gingerbread man. He's sinking. And then finally, we have the cookie butter hot cocoa topped with whipped cream and speculoo spice. I think I pronounced that wrong. Anyway, starting off with Christmas sugar cookie hot cocoa. Cheers. Gingerbread. Ooh, this is so fun. I love this so much. Then cookie butter. Ooh, all of these are fantastic. If you are a fan of hot chocolate and you want just a little twist on them, this is a fantastic choice. Kiddos are going to love this. They're going to be obsessed. All right, we just finished. What was everyone's favorite part of the festival? I knew I was going first and I couldn't remember. So, I'm going to say the Mexico holiday kitchen. I'm going to say all the decorations. Ooh, definitely the American holiday table. Mine has to be the Rubic from favorites of festivals past. Oo, and I love seeing Constants's woo as a narrator of the processional, the candle light processional. We did it. Thank you guys so much for hanging out with us.

And while you're down there, go ahead and turn on notifications so you'll be the first to know when myself or one of my friends puts out a brand new video. Something we do all week. Why?

      "transcript": "We just had the best day ever in Disney's Hollywood Studios and we're going to show you how you can have the perfect day, too. Follow along. It's going to include some face paint and spoiler. What? Hey, you're spoiling it. They didn't know that. Sorry. I think we need a montage. I think this deserves a montage. Yeah. [Music] All right. Starting the day with two different roof drop strategies. We're trying something out. We're going to show an early entry strategy. if you do have early entry like Fry and a non- early entry strategy if you don't have early entry like me. So Fry is going to do what we recommend on early entry. I'm going to do what we recommend if you don't have it. Different vibes. But you'll notice I'm in the park despite the fact that it's not open for me for another long time. Mhm. I love this train. Me too. And that's because you can now enter Hollywood Studios as a regular guest without early entry. About an hour before regular park drop is when they open the gates and everybody gets to go in. And then 30 minutes prior to park open, that's when the hotel guests get to go through little gated areas in the park to go to the rides, which I'm not going to be able to do. But I could get Starbucks. Am I going to do that? Maybe. But you know my order. I'm not going to see you for hours like walking around with like a It's all water. I put it in a popcorn bucket so that I can take it on Tower of Terror. All right. Well, best of luck on your rope drop. I'm going to go probably get a coffee, I guess. I'm going to go ride Slinky Dog Day D. Enjoy. Early entry is a perk that you can only get from staying at a Disney World Resort hotel. It's a pretty big perk, though. It's 30 minutes of extra time in the morning to enjoy the attractions in the park. It just started, so it's 8:30 right now. The park opens for everybody at 9:00 a.m. And 30 minutes might not seem like a lot of time to get a lot done, but it is a lot of time to beat the lines. When we say rope drop, we're not just talking about that first couple minutes when you get into the park. We're talking about anywhere between the first hour to 2 hours when the park opens where you can get through a lot because the lines are low because people are still trickling in. That's rope drop. And we are going to be going from open to close today to show just how much you can get done if you do that. We're going to go grab a coffee. One of the longest lines around park open is actually going to be at Charlie Car Cafe, which is this park Starbucks. And you can beat it if you use this early entry time uh when you don't have early entry to go get yourself your caffeine fuel. We are here with early entry. I am a hotel guest right now during this trip because I'm here for the wine and dine half marathon race weekend. So, it's easier to rely on Disney transportation to get you to the race that morning. So, I've got a hotel for the next couple days. Also, oh my gosh. And it wasn't even looking. All of that is gone. So sad. But we are heading to Slinky Dog Dash. Actually, it's going to be faster to use the ramp. If you really want to get the most out of your day, you probably need to be here before early entry actually starts. So, we're going to see how long this line is. I have no idea what it's going to look like when we turn around the corner. And here we have hit the checkpoint where this is blocked off. They're going to scan our Magic Band to make sure we are a Disney hotel guest. Good morning. Good morning. Let's have a good day. Thank you. Wow. Look, it's so empty. Slicky Dog Dash is one of the most popular attractions here in Hollywood Studios. It's always got a long line and it is terrible to wait in the standby queue in the middle of the day just because it's outside and it's so hot. So, this is one of the best ways to use early entry to knock this one out of the way. Maybe we ride it again later on in the evening. We do have lightning lane for today. Quincy is messing with our lightning lanes as we speak. So, we'll see what she can grab for us. It doesn't look too bad from here. Uh-oh. Well, people are in line, but it looks like they're Oh, just kidding. It is worse than I thought. So, this is the line right here. But remember, they are just now starting to fill up the queue. 8:36. We're getting in line. All right. We're going to sit here for a few minutes. We're going to see if anything happens. We'll give ourselves a timer and we'll re revisit in a few minutes. Two minutes later. Okay, just kidding. After sitting there for 2 minutes, basically when a ride is down, they don't know when it's going to come back up. They have not Slinky is not even on the track. So, that leads me to believe that this might be a longer delay. So, we don't want to sit there and just wait and waste all of our early entry time. We want to get in some rides to take advantage of our hotel perks. And we could easily run over to Rise, and that is what most people do for their rope drop strategy, which is a good one. But if we ride the other two rides here at Toy Story Land, and Slinky all of a sudden reopens, we will be here, we will see it, we will get on. And plus, then we'll be getting multiple rides done in a shorter amount of time. So that's the plan for right now. [Music] Right now they've got the line curving this way, but still no sign or sound of Slinky. So I say, \"Oh, wait. No, Slinky is moving. We're hopping in line.\" Hollywood Tower Hotel, Tower of Terror. Um, the line is posted 13. That means walk on for that ride. Um that is there is a line of like the non- resort guests waiting to get on it at the start of the day. It's about 8 minutes to park open. Um I'm going to start with Rock and Roller Coaster. This one is definitely one that I want to prioritize over Tower because it is closing soon for a lengthy refurbishment where it will get a little rethemed to be Muppets themed. If you go that way, you get your resort key scanned and if you come this way, you can get in the regular non- resort guest line. still delayed. There is no time still, but we are still delayed. [Music] [Music] It's only 9:13 and I'm all the way off a rock and roller coaster headed to Tower of Terror next. Still says 13 minutes [Music] tower chair is pretty much a walk. This is a drop zone attraction themed to the Twilight Zone. So, if we weren't awake after Rock and Roller Coaster, we're going to be awake now. Why is Jimmy Cricket here? Is Jimmy Cricket always here? Why is Jimny Cricket here? Where is he going? It's a thing, by the way. Jiminy Cricket is now meeting near Mickey Min's runaway and he has set times in the app. That's super cool. Slinky is running with nobody on it, which means most folks should be standing by Slinky waiting for it to open. Uh that's the one of the two most popular rides in this park. Bat and Rise of Resistance. So when it's got a delayed opening like this, people will be sort of milling around hoping it opens like a fry, I think. All right, here we go. It's 9:32, so technically we've waited 30 minutes to this point. On our way over here this way, time did jump to 20 minutes. However, I don't think this is actually going to be 20 minutes cuz it just went up. All right, it was only 10 minutes. So, cross your fingers. We got 10 minutes to get on and off this ride and walk over and get on aliens saucers. You think this guy's a sign that we can do it? I hope so. [Music] All right, I didn't quite hit my 10 a.m. goal. It's 10:01 right now because uh Toy Story Mania was moving a little slow. I got paused a couple of times. So, the ride took longer than usual, but um we're still going to go I think we bugger with Fry uh and do Aliens Rolling Saucers and then both of us then they will have done all of Toy Story Land where with their entry they got through Slinky Dog, Toy Story Mania and Aliens Rolling Saucers in rope drop and I got through Toy Story Mania, Aliens Ring Saucers, Rockin and Tower, which I think is a pretty good trade for Slinky Dog Dash since I didn't have early entry. Aliens rolling saucers. It's gonna be probably our final rope drop ride. And we're together. Sorry, I meant to scream, but it didn't come out. That'll happen. There it is. Very high pitched. I almost couldn't hear it. But aliens saucers is a very fun ride. One that Fry is quite fond of because she's aliensized and she worships the claw. That's something she doesn't say publicly often, but she tells a secret. [Music] [Applause] [Music] All for me. Yeah, all for you. I'm just going to watch. As our reward for a solid rope drop on both parts, we have headed to Ronto Roers. This is a very popular spot because of the famous Ronto wrap. Now, in the morning before 11:00 a.m., you can get the breakfast Ronto wrap, the morning Ronto Wrap. You can also get, if you want, the regular Rancho wrap, which is available all day. This one's got like pork and sllo. They both have a delicious sauce. Is it the same sauce? Yeah, I used to work here. We also got the overnight oats cuz I actually love this as a side because it is kind of a delicious just uh overnight cold oats with fruit and boba topping. So, breakfast time. It's a pretty cool shirt. This is Allar's merch. We do have a merchandise store. Lots of cool shirts with All Ears jokes on them if you've been following the channel or not. There's pretty cool stuff for Disney fans. So, go check that out uh over at the Allers Nut Shop. But we're going to eat Ronto wraps now and also overnight oats and also space water which is the only kind of water fry can drink because she's an alien. Oh breakfast ranch is complete. I'm very full. Me too. I ate the whole run. Yeah, me too. We are in a bit of a long line right now and that is because I would like a black half cold brew from here. We're probably going to pick fry up a cold brew somewhere else. Somewhere. We're doing a cold brew hopping experience. The pro tip that goes with our breakfast is that we had breakfast a little late. We had it around like we picked it up around a little before 11:00. It's a little after 11:00 now. And the reason for doing that, for one, it allowed us to do rope drop. We didn't use up any of that good low weight time by eating our breakfast. We waited till after we had done some low weight. And it means that we won't be hungry for lunch until after peak lunchtime, which means we can get away with not eating right when everybody else is trying to go to the restaurants and the lines get long. There are some specialally cold brews elsewhere. I'm getting the black calf cold brew, which is a Star Wars themed cold brew um topped with kind of like a cream cheese foam and cocoa puffs. Now, for both Ronto Roers and Catacas Kettle, you can mobile order, and we do recommend that. Um, it's going to be a lot quicker than standing in the regular line. We did just stand in the line for this because it wasn't that bad. We're just getting a coffee. But if you know ahead of time you're going to want a Katsaka's um popcorn or cold brew or if you want your Ronto wrap, definitely mobile order it. It is so much faster. You can do it ahead of time way before you want to eat. Our first Lightning Lane of the day is Mickey and Minis Runaway Railway. We did buy Lightning Lane for today because it is a perfect day. We're not going to use it probably to its full potential, but we are going to use it as much as we can to ride a bunch of rides that we want to ride without it. So, Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway is a newer ride here in Hollywood Studios. You are transported into the world of Mickey Cartoons. There's two main ways you can use Skip the Line Service Lightning. You can emerge multipass which works for a bunch of different rides and you book three windows at a time or you can use single pass which works all a cart for like certain rides. In this park it's just rise the resistance. We are going to probably suffer the weight for rise hopefully later in the day when it goes down a bit. If you really want to see how to how to use the system, how to work it. We have lots of videos on the channel where we use it in like a challenge format or like any lightning lane video. We really explain it. We push it to its limits. You will really learn how to use it. In this video, we're using it the way we recommend. We're just more relaxed. You'll notice we're not on our phones all day trying to get better lightning lane times because we're just taking what we can get and getting some short weights throughout the day and making sure we get our money's worth with it. And that's good enough for us. So, one key thing about using Lightning Lane is you book three of your Lightning Lanes in advance. In Hollywood Studios and every park except Animal Kingdom, you book one from tier one and your other two have to be from the tier 2 attractions. So, the really popular rides when you really want to skip those lines are going to be in tier one. After you use your first lightning lane of the day, then you can modify your others in a tier one. The tier system goes away, so you can book whatever you want. So, now that we've used a lightning lane, which we did do kind of around 11:00, so not the earliest, not the latest, we can kind of keep an eye on our app to maybe try to get Slinky Dog Dash or switch one to do Rocket Roller Coaster again later for me and the first time for them. So, probably what I'm going to do cuz right now we're holding on to Tower of Terror and Toy Story Mania. We don't need another Toy Story Mania. So, going to go ahead and modify that one to one of the like higher demand attractions. Now, let's always do, we say hello and thank you to Walt in his train car. We thought about heading to Mermaid after this, but we're not quite timed right for it. But a perfect day means no stress, and that means lots of options because we did the stressful things early, and we're going to do more stressful things later when they're not stressful anymore. You want to get your cold brew? Can I get my cold brew? Let's get your cold brew. So Fry is getting your cold brew from Epic Eats. They're out of cold brew. Oh, it'll come back later today, but it's not there right now. They're brewing it. I see. Oh, we'll pitch we go ride star tours real quick. Is that a good idea? Sure. All right, we're going on a Star Tours real quick. This is the easiest Oh, yeah. There he is. There he is. This is a motion simulator attraction that takes you through a Star Wars story where you basically are boarding the uh equivalent of like a passenger airplane in the Star Wars universe and taking off to a randomized story. They're different a lot of the times that you ride it. So you might get a story that is from the prequel era, the sequel era. You could see characters from the original trilogy. You could see You never know who you're going to see. super super low low weights most of the time. If you ever see this above 15 minutes, ride it later. It will drop. [Applause] Okay, forewarning. Star Wars is a much bumpier, more thrilling, crazy ride when you are out on the outside, especially towards the four corners. That was a little bumpy for us. So, we both sat there and we were like, \"Wo, this is more crazy than we remember, but we were pretty much on a corner.\" So, we are actually going to former animation courtyard. We are going to go see the new the newer edition of The Little Mermaid Show. I have seen it. Quincy hasn't yet. I love it. It I think it's so cute and it's so fun and all of the different elements they use to tell the story is very new and exciting and it's just a fun watch. Now, because of all the construction going on in this former animation courtyard, the Little Mermaid Show is still open. You just have to go farther to the right to find the entrance. It's still here. Left. Yeah, you know what I mean. Anyways, we're here. We made it to the show. Enjoy. I just said, I have a fun fact if you want to put it on camera. So, right here in this very spot, actually, this spot in line is where I found out that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelsey got engaged. Big moment. Hallowed ground. You remember earlier when she screamed and a sound came out? That probably happened here. It's a good day. Yeah. All right, we're seated. I'm so excited. I already love what we're looking at. I'm really looking forward to this performance, Sebastian. Especially my little Ariel. Ah, yes. She has the most beautiful vibes. Okay, ma'am. How was your first viewing of The Little Mermaid Show? Oh, I really liked it. I just really, really liked it. I love any show that has live singing and live performers. Um, which is actually not too hard to find in this park. Uh, but it's fewer and far between in Disney World in general, but I'm a big fan of like actual little stage shows. And the puppets on that were so cool. I've seen like stage adaptations of, you know, Ariel before. It was definitely my favorite way I've ever seen Mermaid Ariel done. I agree. I think it looks so good and I it's just it was a super cute little show. As always, I miss Vanessa. That's such a cool part of the movie. Of course. Yes. But it it used so many different elements. It's puppets. It's live actors. It's screen and it's like multi-layered screens which whenever they do that, it just makes you think of like the multi-planer uh animation setup. Yes. Which we can go learn about in multi presents later. We can and we should. I think it's definitely worth your time to do. It's in the air conditioning. Little kids love it. Yes. And it's also awesome for adults because there's live performance and all this cool stuff to look at on stage. I do think it's not talked about enough. We arrived 10 minutes in advance and can get in, which is super cool for a show that's that new. Mhm. Hollywood Studios, you want to do rope drop the way we did it so that you can do the shows without being stressed out and do the shows in the middle of the day when it's hot. Yes. So now we I mean we're basically in a marathon of shows where we just get to sit in either indoor sea theaters or in cool shaded theaters which we can have snacks and drinks in when we go see uh the two outdoor shows which is Beauty and the Beast live on stage and my personal favorite Indiana Jones spectacular. But before hopefully I think we're going to make it. It's 105. It's 105. So it depends on if it fills up. I don't think it will. We are headed to see Villains Unfairly Ever After, which is an all year's favorite. Um, but hopefully we get into the show. We're walking up about three minutes before it's supposed to start. Ah, we may not have made it. But as you can see, lots of showtime. So, it's okay if we didn't. Uh, all right. Sure enough, as we said, you really don't want to cut it closer than 15 minutes in advance for these shows, any show in Disney World. And even then, you might not you might miss the seating. We were too late. The show's at capacity. So, the next show's at 150. Um, Rock and Roller Coaster is currently down and Tower of Terror is at a 70minute wait. So, we won't be doing that. The good news is we needed to go to the bathroom. Hey, you know what? What? You still haven't watched my bathroom video. I still haven't watched your bathroom video. Maybe you guys have and you know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hey, Fry Pitch. You want to get our faces painted? Do you want to get Do you want to get our faces painted? Yeah. Rockin is down. um which I said already, but they just dumped the queue, which means it's really down, but it also means that no one is in the queue. So, if it were to come back up hypothetically while we were still over here, that would be really cool for us. Would be don't think it's going to happen. They are dumping dumping the queue. [Music] [Music] We got our face paint done. We went with show and spo. So, I got mermaid also for my mermaid shirt, which I didn't even realize. And she got dark fairy, which is of course Maleficent. But villains and Billy Ever. So excited. Now, this time we're here 10 minutes in advance and we are making it. So, just so you have the idea. We have I'm having so much fun today. Well done. But define fair. Beautiful. Uh, we loved villains. We do love villains. Um, Hook won. I cheered for Hook mostly cuz I have mermaid stuff on, which is all Peter Pan stuff. I cheered for Maleficent, but I'm happy that Hook won. Yes, we always support Hook in this house. We do. I've only ever seen Hook win. Um, and I supported Hook before that show even existed and we had a I've always supported. You have You take the crown for that. I love Captain Hook. We're We got to ride Tower of Terror now, which I've already done. my second go, but we were able to get a lightning lane for right now for like early afternoon for this. So, we're going to ride Tower of Terror again for me and for the first time for Fry. [Music] All right, we we towered and we terrored and we went to the Twilight Zone, but don't worry, we escaped cuz we were really hungry. So, we have to head to ABC Commissary. This is a quick service spot that serves up like tacos, loaded uh buffalo chicken grilled cheese. I got shrimp tacos. They're a little spicy. Not like spicy, but you're totally averse. You'll notice they're a little pleasant heat to them. The shrimp is well cooked and like well prepared. It's probably from frozen, but in the taco, you can't tell. Comes with like Mexican rice and beans. So, a very hearty meal. Good for fueling up mid theme park day. Mhm. I went with my classic, the Buffalo chicken grilled cheese comfort grilled cheese, but bigger level. Oh, there's no not really a cheese pull, but it's got Buffalo chicken dip in there. It's really good. It's that comfort grilled cheese, but with a little bit of protein in it. You can always find seating in here. You can always mobile order it quickly. Classic foods that everybody will like. And if you're like, \"Oh, I went to ABC Commissary 5 years ago and it was bad.\" They changed the whole menu. That's why we recommend it now. Mhm. Now, typically I like to grab a beer from Baseline Tap House, but that one is very popular, has a bit of a line right now, and we didn't think we'd make it to Indie, which is very important to us. So, instead, we swung by here where they have Kona Longboard on Draft, which is what I got. And Fry got the Snake Alley, which is coconut rum, creme to banana, melon lor, sweet and sour, and pineapple juice. So, a very tropical drink. You want to know what I think will make it taste better? What? Looking at the Indiana Jones stunt spectacular, [Music] how is the Indiana Jones sun spectacular? I loved it. I want to work there so badly. What? Who do you want to be? I want to be the casting director or uh cameraman number four. You could be Marion. Do you do gymnastics? I could. It's just something about old MGM, how movies are made. And even just now walking out, I heard some dad explain to his kid. All I heard was Yeah. So like you see how the cameras are moving around when all the actors have it. Like that's how real movies are made and that's a cool like Yeah, it is so cool. If I recommend one show, it's this one. All the shows we've seen today are incredible. This one is just a real standout because of what it is. Like there's just not really shows like this anymore. Uh we are going to quickly do our character meet and greet for the day. We're going to meet Olaf. This is a popular one, but it does tend to get a shorter line later in the afternoon, which is why we've waited to do it. Um so he's only a posted 15-minute wait right now. You don't want to wait too long to do character meet and greets because they absolutely will close earlier than other stuff in the parks. That's all posted in the app. So if it's a meet and greet with listed times, often times the last time is going to be around 4 at the latest. Um, and if it's one of these with a wait, sometimes they're open the full park day, but make sure you check so that you don't end up missing out on a must do meet and greet. I don't even think this Olaf wait is going to be 15 minutes. It looks more like 5. Hi Olaf. How's it going? Very summery in here. Yeah. So nice and warm, hot, all things. Yeah. Pretty good. You wearing your sunscreen? Always. You have to wear sunscreen. You have to wear sunscreen on the carrot nose. Extra important. Just something interesting just happened. We thought we'd share. The photo machine was like having difficulties linking photos when you scanned your Magic Band or your park ticket. It was having trouble giving you your Olaf photos. She was explaining to us that all we have to do uh which this is true of any photo. It's not just technical difficulties. If you miss a ride photo, it doesn't come to your account when you expect it. You don't scan for it. Uh anything like that. You don't for some reason you don't see photographers photos, anything like that. you can go to the uh photo pass stop at the front of the park. In this case, it's at Sid Kenas. And uh you just go there and you say, you know, hey, uh I was on Tower of Terror at 3:20 p.m. and my my thing didn't populate. They will pull up the photos for that time and go through them with you until you find your photos. Then they can link them to your account. Same thing here with Olaf. Oh, we were at Olaf. It was, you know, 510. Uh they didn't link correctly. they will go through with you and find the photos so they can link to your account. Millennium Falcon Smugglers Run is where we have headed. This is a Lightning Lane for us. So, we did book this a while ago. Um, and it's for right now. So, we're going to do this and then we're thinking we're going to split up to grab some some provisions. Yeah, because we are going to get into the rise line, we think, after that. We really want to ride rise. It usually starts to drop a bit at this time in the afternoon. It's been between 50 and 60 minutes for a second here. So, we just think it's a good time to ride it. This ride is really cool though because you, yes, you you get to fly the Millennium Falcon or maybe you get to shoot the guns or maybe you get to fix it because there's different roles you can have. The most fun is pilot and then the next one is gunner and then the engineer is the least fun. The good news is though, this ride is actually getting a little bit of a revamp where there will be uh one, new story lines, two multiple story lines. So you might see different things each time you ride, and three, the engineer is actually going to get to pick where you go. So it's going to add a lot of interest to that engineer role, which is typically one of the least uh exciting ones you can get. But we are headed up in that lighting lane and we're going to fly the Falcon. It's all right. I got it. quick. We're now headed uh a little out of the way to grab ourselves provisions for the rise line. We're getting fry or cold brew that was not available earlier. I might I might go all the way to Starbucks. I know it's crazy. Listen, if they don't have a car, you're going to need to go to Starbucks, too. So, we'll we'll we'll stay together. Yeah. Um but we're just getting some stuff cuz the rides line is 55 minutes, which if we're lucky, it'll be more like 40, but it's still long enough to have a little drink. And that's one of my biggest pro tips is that waiting in don't make waiting in line wasted time. Get yourself the Mickey bar. Get yourself the beer. Get yourself the coffee. Get yourself the frozen coke. Get everybody in the family a thing of chicken tenders and share them. You know, like don't make it wasted time. Use it as snack time as hang out time as rest time. The only thing is you are probably going to be on your feet. So, it's not a full rest, which is why we took a little bit longer at lunch. Just having a nice sit. All right, back at Epic Eats for the epic cold brew spectacular, hopefully. [Music] All right, we're headed into Rise of Resistance. Rise has popped up to 70 minutes, which is longer than we wanted to wait for it because it usually does get down into the 4050 range and sometimes even, if you're really lucky, down into the 20 range towards the end of the night. But that is risky because rides can also go down really easily and then not come back up. So it's 70 posted right now. But one thing I'll say is it's looks visually shorter than it did when it was 50 posted. And it's been ping ponging between 50 and 70. So I'm going to guess it's going to be less than 70. Maybe 45. 45 I think is a really solid guess. All right. 35 minutes later and we're we're here. So, what my little tip for this is that if you are watching a ride line and you see it fluctuating up and down, go when it's up because that means people are getting in line when it's short and and not getting in line when it's long, which is why the wait time is fluctuating like that. So, if you get in when it's long, it means that people aren't getting in the line right then and usually it's much shorter. But, you have to be keeping an eye to know that it's fluctuating. You can't just get in a long line that you haven't been watching and think that's going to happen. [Music] This does not look good. Try to find another way down to the escape halls. All right, we booked it all the way down sunset because we have a Lightning Leaf for Rock and Roller Coaster we've been hanging on to. Uh this is probably our second to last Lightning Lane of the night. We got one for Slinky Dog Dash earlier, so that'll be our very last. So, we got one of the last ones of the day. We are taking a little shopping moment. Shopping must do. Yes, it's the end of the day, but at the very, very end the shops will get really crowded. Sunset Boulevard, great place to shop. Hollywood Boulevard, great place to shop. Lots of shops on both. All right, let's pick out what we would buy for each other. Contender. Minnie Mouse fanny pack. Fry loves Minnie Mouse and she loves fanny packs. This is a contender. I don't know what Quincy would want. Probably not a keychain. Conveniently, we have stepped into the shop that has the exit merch for um both villains and the Beauty and the Beast show. I just want to look at the Beauty and the Beast because that's Fry's favorite movie. Honestly, she probably has these journals. This would be a good contender, too. That's actually really cute, but it's for kids. They don't have an Eeyore plush. Typical. Honestly, this is so cute. And I could see her just drinking out of this while filming at home or just sitting at her desk. And I think I'm going to go with this. I found it, but I can't reach it. It's too high up. I can't reach it. That one. I like that. I love looking at that. Right. This is what I picked for you. Oo, I like it. in a bean house fanny pack. But this was so pretty. I was like, I could have seen you drink out of this at home. What is this outfit, Mickey? Mickey, I don't think Minnie saw that before he left the house. I know. And she definitely didn't sew it for you like she usually does. This is quite the thing. Yeah, I I'm going to have to It's a no for me. We are now in Toy Story Land at night. This is one of those lands that I encourage you to do during the day, come back at night. It just changes the atmosphere and ambiance. It's very fun. Slinky Dog Dash. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of an intense roller coaster for a family coaster, to be honest. It is. And it's a little scary cuz you're really high up and you can see like the whole park. It sometimes still freaks me out just a little bit. All right. You did them both today. Day or night? I like them both, but I'm I think I'm going to say night is better. Night is better. I'm glad we got that lightning lane. We are going to do a mini dinner cuz we're still We had such a big lunch, but we're still not super hungry. Yeah. And then we had ice cream. I had ice cream. You did? And Yeah. You had a cold brew. We're going to have a mini dinner here by going to Woody's lunchbox, which we were planning on doing, but it's a very good spot. It is. And I think it's going to be a good dinner. Yeah, I'm excited. We're sharing Tachos. We were both a little too full for lunch, but as you can see, this guy is not a small portion. It's a big old portion of loaded tater tots, sour cream, beans, chili, gravy. It smells incredible. Gravy in the morning. There's Well, it's kind of gravy right now. It's cheese sauce, I guess. Queso, cheese sauce. That's what I said. cheese with cheese sauce gravy and there's burritos. There's corn chips. Uhhuh. For a little crunch. Literally, the park closes very soon. So, we're eating this and then we're heading to our big finale, which if you don't know is what is often considered one of the best shows in Disney World. Yes. This and Happily Ever After are hotly contested as the best nighttime spectacular. We're going to see Fantasmic. So, that's where we're headed after this because there are two showings of Fantastic. There's an 8:00 p.m. which already happens, and there's a 9:30. The park closes at 9:00. The final showing of fantasm is at 9:30 which is great because seeing fantasm takes up a ton of time but they because they put one after park is closed it doesn't take up a ton of your park day. So it's perfect for a perfect day where we had so much to do and got through so much. Uh one thing we did notice uh we prioritized mermaids today and villains because they're newer shows and we really wanted to see them. If you're okay with like risking those you could save them for later cuz both of them have shows in the evening. It's all about priorities with a perfect day. You want to have the priorities of your group that everybody has their like top three. You make sure you hit those. Then everything else is a bonus. We absolutely got through so much fun stuff today. And Fantastic is going to be the cherry on top. And the tachos are the whipped cream that the cherry is going to sit on. I like that. Thank you. I made it up while I was talking. That's really good. Where'd my hot sauce go? All right, our little snack is on. We are headed to Fantastic. I think we're going to make it. Just just barely make it. barely make it. So fantastic Broadway for our big family on the night and then I think we can call it a perfect day. I think we rehearsing for Jollywood Nights. Look at the stage. You think Miss Piggy's over there? Miss Piggy might be over there and Kermit. We can't miss Fantastic. Oh my gosh. Sorry. [Music] [Music] Brian, would you call it a perfect day? Oh, you know, I think it was a pretty perfect day. And I'm going to say something. I think you guys can do it, too. But with everything we shared today, follow our tips and you will also have the perfect day at Hollywood Studios. And remember, just because our perfect day ran exactly like this doesn't mean yours will. You might have different priorities. You might have different plans and things might go wrong. But having an attitude where you are happy to pivot, happy to have the best day ever, no matter what comes your way means you will. You will. And that's the allar's way. Yeah. It's all about spending time with your friends and family. That's the best part is getting your face painted with your friends. though. If you're still here, like this video and drop this secret code in the comments so you know you made it all the way. Plus, don't forget to subscribe because we upload tips, games, perfect days, info, and more from Disney World all week. Why, Fry? Because we're serious about fun. That is so true. Thanks for watching. Also, if you get your face painted, post it and let us see it. Maybe the edi editor cut it so you don't even know. Yeah. Anyways, see you next time. Bye."

      "transcript": "Guess what we're doing? What? We're eating at one of the most recommended restaurants in Disney World. We're going to be in Napoli, which is an Italian restaurant located in Epcot. It is very, very popular. And we are going to see what all the fuss is about with a full review and whether or not you should eat there. So delicious. Let's head inside. Let's do it. We are at our table at Bianapoli. Uh it is the atmosphere. That's what we're talking about right now. our comments on the atmosphere. I think this is a beautiful restaurant. I'm transported. It is so light and airy in here everywhere. Even though you have these kind of you have the kind of we're in the what would you call this? The Loia. I don't think that's accurate. It's something almost like a atrium or like Yeah, it's we're off to the side and we have these Florida ceiling aarium. The salon. We have these floor to ceiling windows in here and these beautiful walls that like I mean again it really transports you and there's tons of natural light. And then the I like the crayon added by the children. The children are really cooking with this. And then the main dining room, beautiful vated ceilings. It feels very they're very transported. And then there's Italian art. The chandelier when you walk in, you have to look at it. It is so gorgeous and fun and playful. Um and my favorite theming element is that the three ovens that the pizzas are cooked in uh are named after volcanoes in Italy. Um, I love the olive oil containers on top of some of the waiter stations, too. It's just an awesome atmosphere. Beautiful atmosphere. I see why people love the vibe of coming here. It does feel like a break from your theme park day in a really effective way. Um, and I just will go ahead and comment on the fact that um, we are in the Italy pavilion in Epcot, which means the staff here primarily is going to be cultural representatives from Italy who are on a program to come and work at Epcot, share their culture here. And the Italian customers are the best. I love speaking to the customers here. They are so wonderful to talk to and they love sharing their culture and like tips. Yeah, I love the atmosphere. And we are starting with um drinks soon. Couple drinks. All right, I am kicking off our meal with their star cocktail, which is the lemonchello mule right here. It comes in this beautiful mule glass. And the reason I got this is cuz one, it's their featured cocktail. Two, I hear that everybody gets it. And three, I've been recommended this by several of the Italian cast members in this pavilion who've said, \"You have to go to an apple. You have to get the lemonchello mule.\" So, here I am. I'm doing it. If you're watching this, it's quite good. I don't typically like to pay for mules, even though they're one of my favorite cocktails because they typically are mostly ginger beer. And it's a very easy cocktail to make at home and have it taste just like it does at a restaurant. And whether you add different flavors and stuff, it usually doesn't taste that different from a basic mule. So, it doesn't feel great to like spend, you know, almost $20 on a cocktail out and just get something you can make at home. This is not that. There are a lot of fruit juices in this. So, it really is more like a fruity cocktail, but it's not super sweet cuz the ginger from the ginger beer is cutting through that, but it's not super gingery either. So, if you're not a ginger beer person, I still think you'll like this unlike most meals. The lemonchello also lemon cello is a very sweet, very lemony laour that is super Italian. You have to get it if you're in the Italy pavilion. Um, it's a very overpowering flavor. Balanc is in this drink. So, this is a very balanced drink. It is on the sweeter side, but it's very refreshing, very summery, kind of like um a sweeter sangria. Definitely a really tasty cocktail. I see why it's so often recommended and why they feature it. Brie love, do you care to try this housemade aqua fresca? This is a housemade aqua strawberry aqua fresca. Aqua aqua fresca. Aqua fresca. You know why? because it's Italian and not Spanish. Oh, this is so good. This is mashed up strawberries and like sparkling water. It tastes like pure real strawberries, maybe pureed. If any sugar's added, it's very light. This is not a soda. This is not even a juice. No, I think the effervescence that I thought was there the first time I sipped was actually the tartness from real strawberries. For my appetizer, um, I got the aranchchini, which are basically rice balls. They have a little bit of sausage, a little bit of cheese in them, but they're mostly breaded and fried risotto with their housemade marinara, a little bit of parmesan on top. Very good. Aranchchini. A perfect nice like fry on that breadcrumb out outing and a ton of high quality risoto. Just a little hint of the the cheese and the filling. I wish there was a bit more filling. It's a lot of kind of just rice when you bite into it, but I love rice and I love flavorful rice. This definitely like the rice definitely has like a meat flavor as if it was cooked in a stock. And it's risoto, so it's a creamier rice in general and it's a great texture with that crispier coating. The star here, actually, I think is the marinara. The marinara here is so incredible. It is um a little looser than your typical marinara. There's no tomato chunks. It's very smooth, very bright flavors. Um, the perfect hint of acidity and it just is the best like savory tomatoey sauce. Um, so that the aranchchini is a vessel for bironara is really the win here. My one complaint, it's honestly a little on the bland side. Um, I wish there was a bit more filling to help vary it up, but I think that's kind of typical of traditional aranchchini. So, this is a very tasty dish and honestly very picky eater friendly while still being very authentically Italian. I love fkaca. It's not listed as a plant-based offering on the menu, but we checked with a waiter who told us the marinara that is served on the side is not plant-based due to the fact that they cook the meatballs in the same sauce. And therefore, I get to eat what I've traditionally always had with the with pkatcha, which is olive oil. And this is good all spoiler alert. I know. I'm so excited. The olive oil is so good. Almost floral. It almost has a rosemary quality. Great crust on the bread. Oh my gosh. But the bottom side is soft. The whole inside of the bread is super soft. I'm in love with this bread. I believe there is there is rosemary in the bread. So that's some where some of the fragrance or some of the fragrant, you know, aromatic flavor is coming from. That doesn't diminish how wonderful, high quality, delicious the olive oil itself is, but this is an herb, a lightly herbed bread. We've made it to the entree course. Uh, of course, this is an Italian restaurant, so they do have entre, but the name of the game is pretty much pizza and pasta. And the pizzas here are wild. They do have one called the uh Quattro Mezzo, which is a meter long pizza. We got an individual pizza in a reasonable way. But if you have a lot of people, meter long pizza could actually be pretty good bang for your buck. Um, trying out the ki, which I am saying correctly, which is a white pizza with olive oil and artichoke. Um, and they do have a lot of cheeses on their pizzas. This one has fontina. I'm going to get a big chunk of artichoke just to fully judge it. The Anapoli is often called the best pizza in Disney World. I think that's with good reason. You can see just how well made this is from the way the cheese soaks into the crust. A very thin crust, traditional pizza, but a nice crisp on the outside, made in those beautiful stone pizza ovens. Thick layer of cheese, but seasoned perfectly with olive oil. And then the artichokes on this are so soft and delicate that they mix into your bite perfectly, but add this slight, very slight vinegary tang on the nose to really spice this up and to be a really interesting slice of pizza. And then they have four cheese and meat lovers and margarita. But wanted to go a little more interesting here. And the artichoke I think is really really a plus up on this pizza. Um this is a white pizza where there just isn't a ton of sauce here. Uh I think it's just olive oil in this case. Um it's not like there's a white sauce like when you get pizza from Papa John's that has white sauce which I do like but it's not very authentically Italian. I think it's like ranch or Alfredo and it's so good. But, uh, this piece of pizza is very high quality, very delicious. And honestly, this is the individual pizza. Um, it's a 12 in. I think it's sharable. It's like huge. Um, so good good sharable bite there. Um, but I've got the torillini here. This is stuffed pasta. It does have sauteed panchetta, sweet peas, and it is a parmesan cream sauce, which is very thick. You can see that it's very, very cheesy. Look at that. So cheesy explosion of cheese flavor. The tortoillinis are perfectly al dente and beautifully formed. These are like the ideal shape of tortoillinis. This one is kind of coming apart a bit, but you can see what I mean. Sorry for holding it, but I just want to demonstrate. You can see what I mean with this perfect little U shape. The tortoillini. They're folded so well. Cooked al dente with pasta is a nice yellowish color. Um, and it's got that pleasant starchiness that makes it a bit indulgent while still feeling like it doesn't overpower um, any of the accompaniments, which are delicious here. This is comfort food in a fancy way. This is cheese stuffed pasta covered in a parmesan cheese sauce. And the meat in this kind of just tastes like bacon. It's rich and indulgent, but it's a portion that doesn't seem too heavy or feel too heavy, even for a theme park day. And that parmesan sauce adds this sharpness that really cuts through the richness and makes it just tastes very very good. Um, I'm a fan of the torellini if it's indication of the other pastas they're cooking. And now you get to hear about something that everyone every vegan loves and doesn't dread at all, which is the vegan pizza. This is an off-men vegan item. It's not something you'll find on the menu. That's literally what that means. It's off menu and and you can't find it on the menu. You have to know about it. You have to ask what their vegan options are. Not a fan of vegan cheese on pizza. This is giving me a lot of what I don't like, which is the cream cheese kind of consistency from it that gets stuck on your teeth and on the roof of your mouth. There's something about this crust though because it's so soft itself. It's such a delicious crust. Okay, this is what I would do in the future to be perfectly honest. I would definitely not get it with vegan cheese again just because, no offense to them. This has nothing to do with them. And maybe, no offense to you, maybe you love vegan cheese on pizza. You love that soft cheese. I don't. I would request to have vegetables put on this with the sauce. No cheese that way. Um, that being said, I'm glad I tried it and I I'm gonna eat the whole thing because I'm really hungry and and it's it's not bad. Like, it's it's good. I just for me, nothing against them. They could have done nothing differently. Having vegan cheese on a pizza is not for me. All right, so we just wrapped up. We paid. Um, it is not a cheap restaurant, but it's not the most expensive either. It's definitely a splurge any Disney table service is, but it's not like signature dining super expensive. Okay, so overall, how do we feel about being I had a great time. You know, I would do things a little bit differently. Um, the crust on the pizza was so exceptionally good. I teased the in the intro that the water comes from Pennsylvania. They literally import uh water from Pennsylvania because it matches so closely the uh minerality of Italy, Naples, Italy, and the olive oil. Oh, so good. Like the the ingredients. Exactly. They really I mean they go all out to make this as authentic as humanly possible. And it you can taste it. Yeah. A little bit heavier food just by nature of being Italian food. Um which is a lot for the middle of your Epcot day, but it is certainly not the heaviest. And honestly, I think a welcome reprieve. Definitely. If you like Italian food, I think I can recommend this one full stop. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. But yeah, so you should eat at Via Napoli if you are a diehard fan of pizza, cheese, pasta, or any combination. You should eat there if you have a larger party and you're looking for sharables. They have a ton of options for that and some huge tables. And you should eat there if you're looking for a break in the middle of your Epcot day. Maybe you're drinking around the world. This is a a perfectly suitable restaurant where it's located wise for that. But you should skip this one if you're on a tighter budget. It's not the most expensive, but it's certainly not the most cheap. Maybe stick with quick service. And we're literally looking at the pizza window. You can get the same pizzas served that inside the restaurant served by the slice. This isn't always open. In fact, there's a lot of times during the year that it's not open. It's only open during the busiest times. But when it's open, if you see it's open, definitely stop here. Don't even think about it. Um, and then you also should skip if you're in a hurry. Any table service meal in Disney World is going to take a good chunk out of your park day. So, that's something to keep in mind. Um, and then finally, if the menu doesn't call to you, just because everybody says it's the best Italian food or a really good restaurant, doesn't mean you have to go. For me, I'm just not a big Italian food eater. So, even though I thought this was a great quality, I love the service, I love the food, I love the atmosphere, it's not an one that I go to that often because I that the menu doesn't call to me. So, make sure the menu calls to you. And that's via Napoli. If you're still here, like this video and drop this secret code in the comments and we know you made it all the way.

      "transcript": "We booked a stay at Disney World's Yacht Club for the amazing location and the absolutely insane pool. But what actually stood out the most had nothing to do with either of those. Disney's Yacht Club is a deluxe resort with some of the best perks at Disney World. It is walking distance to two theme parks. It's got a mini water park attached to it. It's easy access to the Skyliner system. And the absolute best perk and the thing that we're testing out today is it's pet friendly. It's one of the few pet friendly resorts here at Disney World. So, we packed up Norah's favorite squeaky toy. She loves this llama. And we booked a stay. We did not opt for mobile check-in, which is an option at this resort, but because we weren't exactly sure what would be involved with adding a pet to our room, we just checked in at the front desk. Visit button just for you. Oh my gosh, that's adorable. You're Look at that. Oh, what a cutie pet. He loves it. That is so sweet. Cast members are absolutely amazing. How fun is this? It's your first Disney day. Now, as much as we love the idea of bringing Nora, we really had no idea what to expect. And now, I'll share everything we learned about having a pet at Disney World in just a bit. But first, we wanted to explore what else the yach club had to offer. So, we got Nora cozy in the room and headed to dinner. Now, walking through the yach club together again, the nostalgia instantly kicked in, y'all. This wasn't our first time staying at the yach club. That was actually five years ago on our honeymoon. It was like the perfect chill mix of Disney magic, but also getting to actually relax. The resort itself leans heavily into a New England nautical kind of theme. There's classic navy blues, got like the ship wheels, modle boats, steamboat Willie everywhere. and it feels very like elegant but relaxed with just like a good little sprinkling of Disney in there. The lobby is quiet and smells incredible. If you know, you know. Yacht Club has a lot of really solid dining options. If you're looking for something a little bit more splurgeworthy, we have the Yachtsman steakhouse right back here. We've celebrated a few big life moments here, including our engagement dinner with my family. And it's also consistently delicious. So, the Yachtsman Steakhouse holds a lot of meaning for us, although we skipped it this time. We opted for the Cruise Cup Lounge right next door. You don't need a reservation. Very cool vibe. And you can even get some of the food items off of the Yachtsman steakhouse menu there. like this French onion soup from Next Door, but it's these pull- aart rolls with the roasted garlic that I just like even better than I remember. Also, the prime rib sliders are a must, but we had to hurry up and eat because we still had a lot of exploring to do with Nora. One of the rules of having a dog in your room is that you can't leave them for too long. Also, if they begin barking, then the resort will call you to come check on them. These are two of several rules that come with bringing your doggy to Disney World. There are other rules, and I explain more on what those are in just a little bit, including where exactly your dog can and can't go. But there is also a designated pet relief area that is really close to where the pet friendly rooms are. It was just past the pool and a short walk from our room. And back in our room while Nora was having her dinner, we unpacked her Pluto's welcome kit. Now, this is something that is part of the pet feast. So, this is something that you get when you check in at your dog friendly resort. It has a waste bag holder with some bags in it, of course, yellow Pluto themed. It has a cute dog tag and it has the rules for having your dog in the hotel room as well as a placard that you put outside of your room so that housekeeping and Disney cast members know there's a dog staying in here. Oh, and it also came with this super cute bowl, which of course Nora had to use while she was staying here. And actually, even that bone-shaped mat underneath. We set up her bowls right by the window here because she is such a people dog. She loved watching everyone walking along the boardwalk because our room was in an insane location. That view absolutely incredible. We were able to see the boardwalk and then even later we were able to see the fireworks. But I'm getting ahead of myself because after all this excitement, Nora was ready for a little nap time. So, while she was enjoying herself, we decided to go do the same. This is the Stormalong Bay pool, and it's shared between the yacht club and the beach club, but it is massive. There's even a lazy river, and parts of the pool have sand underneath the water, so it's like you're at the beach. It was so much fun and we probably could have stayed there all evening, but the fireworks were about to start and I was not going to miss this moment. We couldn't have asked for a better morning. We took Nora around the boardwalk because dogs are allowed on the boardwalk, but only in front of the yacht club, so can't make a loop all the way around, but they are able to go on that prominade. They are also able to go inside the resort. You know, grabbed a coffee and sat in the lobby for a bit. They just can't go in the pool area or restaurants. After some more of this absolutely magical Disney morning and some caffeine, time for a room tour. It is day two and we have had quite the time here at Yach Club. I'm going to get all into that. All into that into all of that. I'm going to get into all of that in just a moment, including how our puppy Nora did here at Disney World. But first, there's a lot of great things about this bathroom, including double sinks. Always a win, especially when you're getting ready for the parks early in the morning. Like how this resort has early entry access. Well, all of them do really, but wanting to beline it over to Epcot or Hollywood Studios, you're going to be waking up early. And so, it's great that multiple people can get ready at the same time. Plus, if I can do it. There it is. Plus, with this snazzy pocket door behind me, someone could actually be in the shower while other people are out here using the sink and getting ready that way. So, just maximizes your morning time. There is a lovely two-head shower in there. We got our fantastic smelling bath products. I love the smell of that body wash. Right when you walk into the room, you're met with this little hallway type area where you have a mini fridge. You have a nice curig setup to get your caffeine on in the morning. And then you have these massive wardrobe and storage area right here. Now, moving into the bedroom part of this nice big TV that has all the essentials for a Disney trip. I always love watching the fireworks on there. Oh, but we also had an awesome firework view from this room. All right, but let's talk about these beds. It's got cute little upgrades like this pillow here. How cute is he? Little nautical Mickey. They have recentlyish upgraded all of the soft goods in this hotel. So, meaning things like the pillows. Um, I think this is upgraded from when we stayed here 5 years ago. And something that I really am a fan of is having the two full beds that stay put, meaning like not a Murphy bed. Back to the details. I think the pictures in this room are really cute. And not only are they nautical theme, which is appropriate for the yacht club, but they also have kind of like this retro nautical theme, kind of like the golden age of ships, like the 1920s kind of vibe. Now, this sofa here where Norah has decided she likes to hang out. Though she's not allowed on the sofa, that's part of the restriction of having a dog in your Disney World hotel room. One of my favorite details. This lamp back here, Steo Willie appears. The beds also have space underneath them for storing your luggage, which Nora took full advantage of. And we actually found her this morning sleeping entirely under the bed. Oh my gosh, my chair totally just sank in the gravel here. Yeah. Um, well, apart from that, there is this nice tile patio area here that you can sit out on and enjoy the views. Last night, we were able to see the fireworks from right here. Talk about insanely magical. Getting to bring our doggy and seeing her first fireworks, even better. There was a lot to say about having our dog at Disney World. Although, first had to hit up the ale encompass breakfast because these dark chocolate waffles are legit one of my favorite things at all of Disney World. All right, so let's talk about if you want to bring your furry friend to Disney World. Now, one big question I had before we arrived was, \"How do I even let them know that we're bringing our dog?\" Because there was no indicator for when we reserved the room. I called the yacht club ahead of time and on the phone they said, \"Yeah, just when you check in, just let them know.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" A little skeptical cuz I wasn't sure. budge. Soon as we checked in, I just happened to say, \"Hey, by the way, we have our dog in our car.\" And they're like, \"Great. Here's what we need to do next.\" And those next steps are pay the pet fee, which here at the Yach Club, because it is a deluxe resort was $75. But this isn't the only resort where you can bring your dog. In total, there are four. So, this one along with Art of Animation, Port Orleans, Riverside, and Fort Wilderness. The fee is $50. As of right now as well, you can bring up to two dogs. They can be any size or breed, but they must be well behaved. You are responsible for if they make any noise or any disruption. So, you give the cast members your phone number in case there is anything that's going on while you are away, like out in the parks. This is the dog agreement. Okay. So, guests are responsible for the proper care behavior and waste maintenance of their dogs throughout the resort. Dogs must be leashed or in a pet carrier when outside of the guest room. Dogs may not let may not be in the guest room for more than seven hours. So, you do need to plan that into your Disney day if you are bringing your little furry one. You then sign the agreement at the front desk and the fun begins. Oh, and the other thing that I had a big question about before we arrived was where can she go? Like, how is she going to get around the hotel? Can she even get around the hotel? I was thinking she would just have to stay in our room the whole time, but she's actually allowed pretty much everywhere except for locations that have food and drinks. So, the restaurants, the gift shops, and not allowed near the pool areas. But apart from that, she is free to roam the resort. So, would we stay here again? 100%. You know, 5 years ago, we stayed here for our honeymoon. No dog, no idea what the next few years would hold. And so much has changed since that time, but somehow it still feels the same."

      "transcript": "I I take me home today. Take me back to the sweet sweet. Hey everyone, welcome to a new Disney in detail vlog. And you'll notice that I'm at home rather than in the parks. Don't worry because in a minute we are going to be back in Walt Disney World. I needed to just pop in and do an intro to this video because this was originally supposed to be all one long vlog of the previous day and then us going home, but actually it was quite a lot of footage. It was going to be quite long. So, I decided to split it into two. So, I needed to just drop in and let you know that as to why there was no kind of beginning to this vlog. And this one is going to be starting out in Disney Springs. We went to Homecoming to eat and it was Cla's first time there and also go to World of Disney and we finish off answering your questions. But it's Cla and myself answering your questions cuz you did have a lot of questions for her as well. So all of that is coming up. Stay tuned for that. But this is actually really convenient that I needed to pop in and do this introduction because there is something I've got to show you and this has worked out as perfect timing. As many of you will know, I've partnered with Wild for several years now. I absolutely love their refillable deodorant and they've got something for Black Friday and I have got an amazing offer for you and it's only for a very short period of time. So, I just had to let you know about this. Many of you will know that I absolutely love ombre. I love an ombre moment and this is their newest case that they are launching for Black Friday. It's called Chrome, but it just has this ombre effect as well as being super shiny. I'm obsessed with this. I absolutely love it. And as well as this case and the case for the roll on if you prefer roll on deodorant, they also have the refillable body wash as well. You could use this as body wash or hand wash. But look how beautiful this case is. I love this with the cases because it is a refillable deodorant. I've been giving the cases away to everyone I know and now everybody is using Wild as well. It just works for me even in the Florida heat. I find it works so well and it's just more moisturizing than regular deodorants that I used to use in the past. Black Cherry is one of their newest fragrances. It is honestly one of my favorites they have ever done. Oh my gosh, it is so good. I feel like I could drink it. I'm not going to. Disclaimer, please do not drink or eat any of these as good as they smell. But they also have Winter Breeze. This one reminds me of a Disney lobby. I think this smells a little bit like Clover World, which is the fragrance that smells like the Disney lobby from Bose Signature Candles. That smells really similar. Smell the A little sniff. Yeah, smell that. Oh, yeah. I see what you mean. Doesn't that smell like that? They smell very, very similar. Yeah. And while Paul is here, he is going to have to smell this. They have a warm cinnamon bun fragrance. That there is I'm nicking that one. Yeah. Paul's definitely going to have this one. He uses Wild as well. Pretty much everybody I know does. Now, if you're someone who loves like candles and all the different fragrances, this is like that for deodorant. That's what Wild is like, honestly. And you can get your refills on a subscription as well, just to make it easier so you don't forget to reorder them. And refilling your case is really easy. All you need to do is make sure it's wound down to the bottom. Use the little tabs on the side. Press those and pull the bottom out. Put your refill on the top and then put the case back on and wind it up. That's it. Really, really easy to do. And Wild have given me the best discount code I've ever had for you guys so that you can get your hands on this or any of the cases. This offer is valid for your whole Wild order. Whether it's the refills, the cases, you need to buy gifts for people. It is 33% off. So, you can use the QR code that is up here or you can use the code on the screen, Victoria 33, and that would get you 33% off everything, but that is a very limited deal just for Black Friday. So, if you do want to get that discount code and get that amazing deal, do that quickly because that code won't last very long. So, we're going to get into the vlog now. Next week is going to be the beginning of Disneyland Paris. So, we went to Disneyland Paris recently, Paul's first time. It was the Christmas season. I cannot tell you how magical and amazing it was. I haven't been to Disneyland Paris anywhere near as often as Disney World and I've never been at this time of year and we absolutely loved it. We filmed the Christmas parade, the decorations, the nighttime show blew us away. It was honestly incredible. Um, as well as going to the Walt Disney Studios park and we've got all of that to come. So, that'll be starting next week. But this one is the final episode of me and Cla in Disney World. So, hope you enjoy. Goodbye, Allstar Sports. Bye-bye. We don't want to leave. It's so so sad when you're leaving, but we're all packed up. Um just done the kind of last minute checks. I always put a phone torch on under the bed. Always check everywhere. But yeah, time to go. But we still have Disney Springs. Yes, I know. And homecoming. Yes. So, we're going to go and do that. We've arrived at Disney Springs and it's nice and quiet. I love coming to Disney Springs when it's like this rather than when you're here at mega busy time in the evening or something. This is just nice to stroll around. And homecoming is our destination. Yeah, homecoming is very difficult to get a reservation. It can be quite a challenge. So, I was glad that we got one for this morning. I haven't eaten there for a little while. Got no idea what I'm going to have. It will be lunch stuff, I guess, rather than anything brunchy, but we'll see. I don't know that I've looked at the menu for this. I'm kind of assuming from the name it is quite American comfort food. Comfort food, I would say. Yeah. fried chicken and mashed potatoes and stuff like that. But they do salads. Um I've had the salad with fried chicken before which was really nice. Um the other place we would have gone if we weren't going to homecoming though is right ahead Blaze Pizza. I've never been there. What? No, I've never been. We Yeah. Know we've had it on the list like both times, but I think I don't know whether or not there was like a queue or whether or not we just didn't find it cuz I didn't even know it was here. Oh my gosh. But I think we've ended up in Deluxe Burger rather than Blaze Pizza. Oh, well, you were so close cuz this is Deluxe Burger and this is Blaze Pizza. If you'd got a few more steps, you'd have found it. Yeah, Blaze Pizza I can highly recommend. It's really good value as well, I find for a lot of places can be quite expensive in Disney Springs, but Blaze Pizza is just great. Well, that is why I've tried to go like we've had it on the list because of you recommending it. It's amazing. Yeah. And like you can literally make your own pizza, can't you? Yeah, it's like a create your own. Oh, something smells nice. I think it might be homecoming. And this is the thing. There's just never enough time. Like there's so many different restaurants here at Disney Springs that I love. And in a 9-day trip, we've managed to do one. Where do we eat at Disney Springs? Did we eat here? No, we didn't. We had a drink. Oh, we went to Hoa for a drink. That was it. So, we haven't even managed to do one, which is I really wanted to eat at Moramoto Asia, don't we? I've never tried that. I've um we did have a booking for that, but again, it was just one that we didn't get around to actually doing, but I think that would be nice. There's just so many good ones here. Honestly, I could eat somewhere different every single night of a two week trip. We're just going to be going around the corner overall. Enjoy. Thank you. We are seated our last meal of the trip. I am currently googling what are hush puppies. So, hush puppies are a southern dish consisting of deep fried savory balls or nuggets made from a thick cornmeal batter. And it's really cool in here. I do love it. This is a very popular restaurant here at Disney Springs. All of the food is like very local and very fresh. That's kind of their thing. And they do brunch here. I know that that's really popular on the weekends. On the menu, the thigh high chicken biscuits, I believe, is one of their most popular items. Then they have deileled eggs. Then they've got fried green tomatoes. That actually sounds really nice. Fried pickles. Then they do have like burgers and sandwiches, meatloaf sandwich, catfish sandwich. Then the fried chicken. These are kind of the main signature items. They have it with mashed potatoes and a biscuit. Another one of their really popular items if you look further down is the fried chicken and donuts. Normal sweet donuts and chicken. Yeah. And it looks like they've now partnered with Everglazed who are over by Splitzville Bowling. And another thing that is like a signature here is the Shine on Tap. You can get Shine Flight. So, a taste of all five flavors. I have a coffee because to me it is still morning. So, I need coffee. It's only just still morning, but it's still coffee time in my world. 5 minutes past 11. 10 minutes past 11. So, that is definitely the morning. Our food has arrived. And look how big Cla's plate of chicken and mash. got one, two, and like I know you can get pieces like like KFC boxes where you do get like lots of pieces of chicken, but like if I was serving up dinner, I would have just that one. I wouldn't also have these two. That does look good though. It smells amazing. It does. I got a side of the mac and cheese because I feel like here it's just essential to get that. And that looks so good, that mac and cheese. And then I did get the salad. It's got egg and chicken. The dressing is really nice. It's got the cheddar biscuit croutons. I love this salad, so I had to go for that. The napkin looks like a sort of tea towel. It does look like a British tea towel. Yeah. What are you saying? The mashed potato is delicious. The um Are these like cheese biscuits? Drop biscuits. It's like a cheddar scone kind of thing. And that's very good. I haven't tried the chicken yet. I almost want to pick it up and just eat it with my hands. I feel like that would be a bit too much in here. I wouldn't judge. No, I know. But I would judge myself. But if I was at home in my living room, that's exactly what I do. Oh, yeah. That's nice. Yeah. Yeah. Very good chicken. The coating is actually quite thick. Very nice. Good. Okay. I've got a bite here with the chicken and the egg and the dressing on so that I can fully It's quite a big bite actually. The chicken is really good here. That's what this restaurant is known for, the fried chicken. So, if you do like that, I would recommend getting one of the dishes. Either what CLA has, what I have, or you have the fried chicken and donuts as well, if that's your thing. Um, is good. Very, very good. But when you're getting your ADRs, when you're booking them, I would prioritize trying to get this one because it really is quite difficult to get a reservation. And I don't believe that they use Open Table like some of the Disney Springs restaurants do. Disney Springs. Actually, loads of the restaurants here use Open Table as well as the Disney reservation system. So, when we wanted to get cake bake, we had a reservation earlier in the day and we needed to change it and through the Disney website there was nothing. But I went to Open Table and I was able to get a later one. So, there are quite a few throughout Disney World and some of the non Disney operated ones that use it, but I don't think Homecoming does. So, you need to snag a reservation unless they've started using it. I don't know. And also LA not last year, the year before 23 when I came um I used Open Table for Wagland Road. Yep. Because we were meeting up with like another family, friends of ours and in total there was 10 of us and I couldn't book 10 through Disney whereas Open Table allowed me to. Okay, cool. So that's worth knowing if you got bigger groups as well. But this is delicious. I'm loving this. And we are going to answer some of your questions today as well. So, there are plenty of questions for either Cla or both of us. So, we will be doing those at the airport as well to kill some time because there's always a lot of waiting around. Look at this mac and cheese. Look at the top. That is like hot thick cheese. It does smell so good. Oh, that's good. The thing that's good about that, some of the mac and cheese that I've had over here is much more buttery and less cheesy. And I do like a cheesy mac and cheese. This one because it has that thick layer of cheese on top. It has that nice buttery taste, but it is also very cheesy. So that is Yeah. You can't really see the pasta. No, it's like under a layer of cheese. Yeah, that looks good to me. Try some. Yeah, really good. I am full. So conclusion, the mac and cheese amazing. Absolutely delicious. Like the amount of cheese. That is so cheesy. It's so cheesy. It's got like the thickest layer of cheese I've ever seen. I like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Love that. So, the mac and cheese was amazing. The salad, love the fried chicken. And there was plenty of the fried chicken on the top. The only criticism I've got about this salad, it comes with like tomatoes and cucumbers and bacon as well, but there was hardly any of that. So, there were literally like four halves of cherry tomatoes, a couple of bits of cucumber, and the rest of it is all lettuce. So, I have left a lot of the lettuce um because there was just so much of it. I would have preferred a salad where there's more cucumber and tomato in it because to me those are like the best staples. Yeah. Yeah. You don't mind having the lettuce but like half of it there's loads, isn't there? Yeah. There's like tons and tons and not enough of the other bits. So, that's the only criticism with the salad. But the fried chicken on it was amazing. What did you think? I think it was very delicious. I don't look like I've had that much, but there was three massive pieces of chicken on my plate. So, I've managed to eat one whole piece and about a third of another one. So, I do feel like I've left a lot, but I just couldn't eat it. Mashed potato was delicious and I've had quite a lot of that. And I've had half of the cheesy biscety thing. Um, but yeah, very good. I mean, I definitely would eat it again. I just wish you could all have like half a small a child's portion. Yeah, we were discussing actually that almost I could have ordered this for us to share. Like Victoria and I could have totally then had the chicken and shared the mashed potato and then we could have got just like a side or a couple of sides or or the three sides if we could have Yeah. the trio side. But yeah, it was all really like delicious. So I'd come back again. Oh yeah, 100%. And I believe this restaurant is on the dining plan. I'll put it on the screen or just cut this bit out if I'm incorrect, but I'm fairly certain it is. And I do think that would be a really good use of your credit. But I would do um what me and CLA just said. So one of you order like that chicken meal, one of you order the trio of sides as your main and share cuz then you can try more stuff which is always good. And the coffee is nice as well. So that's always a plus. We have come out to some very slight rain. I was just going to have a look at the queue for Gideon's. Oh, is it up there? Is it? can see there is a reasonably big queue, but it does move quite fast. Oh, is this it? Oh, that's right here. Okay, it does move fast. That's about the same as what it was last year. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm going to get pretzel bites at the airport instead. Okay. Cuz I like them, too. And I'd rather get to World of Disney and make sure we got plenty of time. I hate rushing to get back to your hotel for your M's Connect. Yeah, World of Disney is so big. Like, you want to make sure you have got enough time. And obviously we need to make sure that we get back to the hotel so that we can get picked up to go home. Rushing to do that is quite then worrying and I don't want to do that. So we'll skip Gideon's cookies for today. Although I do love them. Yeah. And Disney Springs is looking stunning as always. It's a little bit drizzly but not enough to warrant putting up an umbrella yet. Although it does look as if it might have actually rained a little bit heavier. Yeah, cuz the ground is wet. So while we were in there, I think we missed a shower. Our first holiday, we ended up going to Sprinkles. Oh, I've never had one. Is it good? Yeah, it was good. But like it was because we were really hungry and we needed somewhere to eat, but everything was closed. It must have been really late. So, we had Yeah. like donuts and milkshake for our dinner at about 11 at night. Love it. Only on vacation. I don't always come back here. They got lucky time there. And Edward Bay, which is sunglasses. There used to be a Pandora back here. Unless I've totally Oh, yeah. No, we did just walk past it. It was Yeah. So, the Pandora's just behind us and Uniclo is down here. And Polite Pig. So, that's just to show you where we are. If you're not sure, Polite Pig is amazing. Here we are. And they have taken down the main sign that was at the top there. You can see it kind of doesn't stand out as well as it normally does. I don't know if they're refurbishing it or doing something different, but World of Disney, I feel like, is a thing that everybody has to do on their last day. Absolutely. For those last minute gifts. I also think one day I need to go to the Daily Poutine. Oh, the Daily Poutine is so good. Yeah, just behind us here. I can highly recommend the Daily Poutine. It's really good. Pretty soon I won't be going around with my little refillable mug. Sad times. I'm on the lookout for a gift for Paul and something for mom because so far I haven't found anything that I wanted for them. These look nice. Mickey and Friends collection for Pandora. I love the Donald. I did purchase a different sweatshirt this morning. I got that cream colored one with the gold writing from Hollywood Studios, but it was too big and it just wasn't going to work at all. So, I exchanged it for a different one in Allstar Sports. I do like that Mickey one as well. These ones have got the character on the front and then on the back you've got like the back of the character and they've got various different characters. I do like these actually. And there's Minnie. Let's have a look at the I think I like the Daisy one the best actually. I do love that. See if there's anything different in terms of bags and spirit jerseys and ears and things. They've got this Small World range featured here. And that's the ears. And Haunted Mansion is featured heavily here with it being Halloween coming up. Look at this doom buggy. This is so cool. Does this light up or something? Has a handle on the top. I'm confused why it has a handle. Is that just to make it easier to get around or or is it like or is it a thing that I don't know what it is? It just looks like a decorative piece. I light up, it says on the label. So, yeah, it does light up. I love that. How cool is that? You see how big it is compared to my hand? It's really quite large. I don't think I've seen this hat before. They have got so much Haunted Mansion stuff. I love this. Got like this rugby style top and then this spirit jersey. I do have a purple Haunted Mansion one from a few years back. That sweatshirt is nice as well. They do really have some nice apparel on this trip. There's loads of stuff that I would have got, but you have to pick one. You can't have it all. I saw this sweatshirt the other day and really liked it. And I feel like it's kind of similar to the t-shirt I'm wearing today. This one says everything is better in Walt Disney World. I think I got this one a couple of years ago here in Disney Springs. This could be nice for Paul because this is the kind of top that he would wear like a polo. And then it has the little D on the sleeve as well. This one feels more like something you would wear to play golf in. I think. Yeah, they actually have golf balls around here. So, I'm assuming that is definitely a golf one. I mean, you could wear it for whatever obviously. I do really like the Haunted Mansion shirt. That is nice. This is always quite a good section if you're looking for last minute gifts cuz they have all the candy things and stuff like that. That's easy to take back. Just take a look in this section cuz Paul does love cooking and kitchen type stuff. I really do love the kitchen towel holder. Saw that the other day. If I had more space, I probably would get that. This is a nice candle. It's got all four parks on it. Ooh, doughut warm cookie scented candle. That smells exactly like the smell on Main Street from the confectionary. Like literally exactly like it. Oh, I really want to get this, but I am going to struggle with the weight. Oh, no. I really want this. Oh, Lumia, one day I will have enough space to bring you back. I haven't this time. They have this wooden block counter for your Disney trips, your countdown. That's really good. I've been struggling to think what to get for mom. I think I'm going to get her these bag clips. You can use them for clipping up, you know, like Chris packets or anything that you need to put a clip on. And they've got a castle, the balloon, and Minnie and Mickey. These are really cute. I might get Paul a tumbler for iced coffee because I've got one that I use. He normally uses his um refillable mug, but maybe I'll get him something like this for iced coffee at home cuz we do drink quite a lot of it. They have a Montreal one. This was like hiding right at the bottom. I think I might have to get him this. Okay, we got our last minute shopping and I did meet some of you guys in there who were also doing your last minute Disney shopping as well. And now it's going to be back to Allstar Sports. Last refill of the refillable mug while we wait for our Mia Connect to arrive. It's always that sad time, but we've had the best time. But we are going to answer a load of your questions when we get to the airport cuz there's always some waiting there. So, we will be doing that. That's still to come. So, stay tuned. Let's just give you a last look at Springs though. It has been a little bit rainy. There's been some showers, but love Disney Springs, especially all of this newer area. I say new, it's not really new now, but it is from what I remember when it was Downtown Disney and Pleasure Island back in the day. Just to let you know the current timings of things, it does vary, but you know, largely stays the same. The last bus from your resort hotel to Disney Springs departs at 11:00 and the last bus going back to your resort hotel will depart at 12:30. So, that's the kind of timings for getting to and from. They will always do their best to get everybody back. But obviously at those times in the morning, you do need to try and get to the last bus because obviously the drivers don't want to be having to take people back at goodness knows what time in the morning. So you might have to get an Uber if you miss it. So we're all packed up and that is going to be it for us leaving Allstar Sports now. I can't believe it. I've just shoehorned the last of the items that I bought from Disney Springs into my suitcase and they barely fitted. I'm really hoping my case is not going to be overweight. Keep everything crossed for me. But yeah, that's going to be it now from this trip. Very soon I will be back though. There's still more to come. I'm going to be filming the airport process and of course answering your questions before we then head back. So stay tuned for more. But yeah, that is going to be it from Allstar Sports. And just like that, we are looking very much UK bound again. Sadly, although I do have my new jumper on, which I love, and hat, obviously bad hair on the plane, so this is when it definitely means it's time to go. The luggage is maxed out. I'm pretty sure it's going to be overweight, so we've been trying to make a plan of action in case it is. And the zip was just breaking, which was a bit worrying. So, I hope it doesn't burst open. No, I don't think it will. It won't. On the plus side with this suitcase, both sides are like zipped. Everything is zipped in. So, even if it did open, stuff wouldn't fall out. Frying out. Yeah. But I think I might need a new suitcase. It's my fault cuz I probably I totally overloaded it. Right. Should we go lifts? Oh, yeah. We've accidentally just gone up and down in the lift a little bit. We need this floor. I'm actually not sure where the Norse desk is. cuz I've not flown with them before. Let's go find It's probably going to be close to the British Airways. Why is it over here? Nor C14. Oh, yeah. It's just around the other side of here. That's why we weren't seeing it. Here it is. We have had to do a little bit of Tetris. Unfortunately, my bag was a tiny bit over. Cla's was a tiny bit under. And now, with any luck, Claire's will be 23 or under. And then we're sorted. But we did not want to pay excess baggage when one of our cases was under. No, we don't. Somebody is putting on a load of clothes over there. Reminds me of Becky. Becky would totally do that. 22.9. Yes, we've avoided the fees. We are through. And Cla's bag got an extra check because of my Bose candle. Nothing to do with me. No, that was the thing that we moved um to go. Oh, you all right? Yeah. There's a new moving walkway. CLA Cla was not ready for that. That was the thing we moved out of my bag into Cla's was the candle and it um alerted and your toiletries. But we obviously did put them in my suitcase. The candle we put in my hand luggage, so don't do that, I guess. Yeah, maybe put those in the big suitcase. They're not liquid, so I don't know why that was. But anyway, now we can get through and have a coffee and relax. I do like it here. This terminal is so much better than the other one. I think we're going to sit down and do our questions in just a second. But we want to get some food first. So, we're going to get a pizza. I had pizza from here last time and it was really nice. I think I'll grab a Starbucks, too. And I'm just going to check out the shop to see if there's anything I want to take on the plane cuz don't forget with Norse, they don't really give you any drinks and stuff and snacks. So, make sure you fill your water bottle and pick up any drinks or anything that you might need. We've got our pizza. It does take kind of a long time to get it from there. So, just make sure that you do go and get it when you've got enough time. It's not like super long, but it's not quick. Yeah. Like you forgot, didn't you, that like last year it did take a while and you forgot this year they cook them like really fresh. So they are nice, but they do take a while. So we've got that. We're just going to have this and then we'll do a few questions and then it'll probably be time to go to the gate pretty much after that. It's question time. That pizza was so good though as well. That was really good. Yeah, it is. I would recommend that pizza. Princess Sizzy is saying, \"What is your favorite value, moderate, and deluxe resorts and why?\" I can't give complete accurate answers cuz I haven't stayed at all of them. I mean, I absolutely thought sports was great. Just then when we were leaving as well and we had to like we meas like got us first, didn't it? And then we went to music and yeah, movies and then music and I looking out the window. I actually liked sports from the outside the most. I think though, especially if I was coming with like young children, Art of Animation was so cool. It is nice. Like the cars area was amazing. So, I think maybe that one would would be what I'd choose. The pool area looked really cool as well. I know what you're going to say for moderate. Yeah, obviously Coronado Springs because it's just incredible. It's amazing. I mean, it is obviously big, so if you're not so good at walking around too much, then that might not be the one for you. It is great. But if you are, then I mean, you can stay in the tower. Yeah. Um that's much more hotel like. Yeah, totally. But like absolutely loved it. That's definitely the best. And then for deluxe, I would say um Wilderness Lodge. Yeah. Or Animal Kingdom Lodge. I just remember last year when I when you took me along to Wilderness Lodge and I was blown away. It is amazing walking up to it and then the doors opening and seeing it. It was lovely. So yeah, I think that's it. I would say Pop Century is my favorite value mainly because of the sky and I do like the rooms there as well. I do enjoy the rooms. Then moderate, I would also say Coronado. I love love love Coronado Springs, especially Grandstino Tower. And then for it's so hard because Polynesian has historically always been my favorite and it kind of still is. I have stayed at Animal Kingdom Lodge more times and we have visited it as well. I am increasingly finding Animal Kingdom Lodge is my favorite too and we went there this trip and that almost just made me even more think that I actually prefer staying there. I love the Polynesian. I love visiting the Polynesian but actually I think maybe Animal Kingdom Lodge. Oh, nice. Might be. Yeah, I really do love it. This is an easy answer to this one. Sher is asking, \"What is something that had the uncontroll had you in uncontrollable giggles on this trip?\" Oh, well, I know what that was. Easy. Claire trying on Halloween costumes in Target. 100%. Great fun. That was probably the most funny thing this entire trip to as well. Like I've heard it and like see cuz so many people have liked it or whatever. I just keep on hearing Victoria laughing. Yeah, my I was doing a total gezer laugh in that. That's the bit that makes me chuckle the most. It really was so funny though. That that's definitely like the biggest laugh. Moy was asking, \"How often does CLA normally get to go to the parks?\" Well, as in like go to Disney at all. How often do you Not enough. Um I came to Victoria last year. Yeah. And I then also went in 2023 with my family. The time before that was 2018 and that was my first time. So I've been four times which I feel is very lucky. I would love to go again. I'm the one that likes Disney the most though out of my whole family. So yeah, you're the big big Disney fan. Yeah, I need to do a little bit of convincing. Vicki is asking for CLA, what is your favorite and least favorite ride at Disney? Favorite is Guardians. Absolutely. Without question. Um probably closely followed by Flight of Passage. Yeah, love that. Um least favorite, it would probably have to be Star Tours. Oh, yeah. Because that makes me feel it for me it just feels like uh turbulence, right? Yeah. It's a bit like that. So, I I don't like feeling sick and and that makes me feel sick. Um I would prefer things like Small World and Dumbo and Astro Orbiter over feeling sick. So, Star Tours it is. Then Jay Condron is asking for both of you favorite coffee or cake place to sit down in the parks. Ooh, in Magic Kingdom it is really quite good at the yellow umbrellas. Yeah, I do love that spot cuz you can get your Starbucks and sit there, but it is also nice to tuck in that little bit down Main Street to just get away from the madness. Yes, the side little side street on Main Street is good, too. Nomad Lounge in Animal Kingdom. Yeah, that was um churros and coffee in Nomad Lounge is so good. And that's in the parks. One that isn't in the parks, but I have to just mention it, is Riviera. So, if you go to the Riviera Resort, they have um Leit Cafe, I think it's called. They have the nicest little cakes and things in there, and you can get a drink and sit in the library next door. When you were doing your live stream yesterday, I went and sat down just around the boardwalk area. Yeah, that is nice. That is also quite nice cuz again, you got lots of benches and it's really quite peaceful and you've got the cake bake shop where you can get such good cake there. So, all of those, but I do not recommend getting the takeout coffee from the cake bake shop. It's very expensive and it's not that great. I already answered this question, but I'll ask Cla. Did you think Gio82 was worth the price? So, I've already answered this. What did you think? Do you think it was? Um, I can't remember exactly how much I spent there. It was like $25 for the cocktails each. The hours. That is a lot. Yeah. And like, if I honestly had to say, do I think that drink was worth $25? Of course not. Like, no. I mean, it is the experience, isn't it? It is the experience. Yeah. And the flatbread was worth what we paid. I think that was like $15 and that was great. So, I would say that was Yeah. I mean, that is obviously on the pricey side, but it is a special place that you're going to like and it is over 21. Like, it just is quite fancy. Um, so I don't know, $25 for one cocktail is loads. Is a lot. But you could get other drinks. Yeah. You didn't have to have that. Yeah, that's true. That's true. So yeah, maybe if you were getting something else then I sort of said I think it is worth it for a special occasion or just to do it at least once. I think it is worth it just to see it. Yeah. This one I was going to get us both to answer. If you could only go to one park for the rest of your life, which would it be? Oh, no way. What? You guys love to give us a mean question. That's quite difficult to answer. So, I thought we would do that one. Mine's Epcot. It would have to be. But I would feel so upset at not being able to do the others. If I had to just only do one, it would be Epcot for me. Oh man, that is so difficult. I couldn't say anything else. I think it would have to be It's either Magic Kingdom or Epcot. Okay. Cuz Magic Kingdom is like when you close your eyes and think of Disney, especially if you're a person that's never been to Disney, Magic Kingdom is more I think anyway, what will pop into your head is classic Disney. You'd never be able to do Guardians again then. I know. I know. I know. That's why it's very difficult. Um, can I just have a little Oh, can we have like a little tunnel? No, you have to pick one. Oh, I think if because I would probably be coming with my family again, I probably would say Magic Kingdom because I'd be devastated that we couldn't go on Guardians and I would still want to sneak off there. And the camera's Cla's drifting out of the the she's still here. Sorry, I was just drifting there. Um, yeah, that is very difficult and I would be so upset to never do Magic Kingdom again. No, I just It's a very hard question. Yeah. Um, rank your favorite methods of Disney transportation. Okay, that's quite a good one. I I mean, I enjoy all of it except for like the buses really. Not that like the bus like the buses themselves are cool that they turn up and how they look. It's just like more boring because you do that kind of thing anyway, don't you? So, I think I actually really like going on the boats. I thought you might say that as your first. Yeah. Yeah. I've just I've really enjoyed that every single time. I like it because it's it's not air con but it's the breeze. I think that's why I like them and it's just cool like going along on the boats. Then probably Montreal for me. Then Skylliner only because I I'm sure I felt a little bit funny when I went on the Sky and it does like goof doesn't it? So that's kind of at the end and then and then the coach. Is that it? Yeah. I think mine would be Skylliner is my favorite. It is quite difficult actually. You would think Montreal would be my second, but I do love the boats and the Montreal can be crowded and that annoys me when the Montreal is crowded and you're just all like in there like sardines. So I think actually I would say Skyliner then boat then Montreal then buses. Yeah. Which is surprising. I thought Monreal would be higher. Right. Let's just do a couple more here. If you could only pick one snack during your trip, what would it be? It's very hard to answer. I think the one that literally jumped into my head straight away then was the creme brulee croissant from Gaston. That was so nice. It really was so good. If I could only have one though cuz in the running with the creme brulee croissant would be the fruit Nutella waffle. Also in the running would be schoolbread. Oh yeah, schoolbread is really good. And I actually love the cheeseburger spring rolls. But I wish they had ketchup there. That's really annoying. Yeah, that is a bummer. They always used to. I think I would have to say the creme brulee croissant though if I'm thinking about eating all of those things. That was like your 10 out of 10. Yeah, I think it would be. It'd have to be that. Yeah, you did. You picked that as well. So, okay. I'm sure I answered this one already. Where can I find the panic and pain plushies? I'm pretty sure I answered that and I'll cut this out if I already did, but it was at the shop at the end of Phil her magic. So, just as you're coming out exiting, it was in the shop there. What are your tips to work around the wait times? Genie Plus is so expensive. So, it can be very expensive if there's multiple people in your party as well. Obviously, for us, it was just us and we only did two days of the multipass. So, that is even a tip in itself. You don't have to do it every day. Oh, no. No. I definitely would. You could if if you can afford to, depending on how big your party is, you could just think, let's just do one day at Magic Kingdom and one day at Hollywood Studios. Um, that's at least one tip there. if you can't afford it at all because it is a lot of money to pay on top of everything else you've already and I wouldn't really bother using it so much at caught on and animal kingdom. I very rarely would use it there. Um, lightning lanes you can do the individual ones. We tend to just do those maybe for guardians, flight of passage, maybe the occasional one for Tron more than using the multipass. My main tip would be I actually would utilize the party days. If you are there during the autumn or winter when there's Halloween or Christmas parties, I would utilize those days in the Magic Kingdom because it's so quiet and you can get almost everything done. Other than that, I would always say if you can go later and stay till close. I find the rides have got less of a wait time near closing than early in the day. The other day I went to Animal Kingdom, you didn't come with me. No. And it was like so the park was closing at 6:00 and I think at about like 4:5ish. I was finishing eating and I was looking at the times. Um I think first of all I went and did the safari cuz that said like 5 minutes and then I had the choice of doing flight of passage or Na'vi River and it said it was like 15minute wait for flight of passage. Like that's pretty good like towards the end of the day. So yeah, I jumped on and did that. I find the end of the day better. Obviously, everybody goes in the morning and does rope drop. And I find that's the busiest time actually. The exception is if you've got the extra half an hour for Disney resort guests. Definitely go and do that. Go and do like the ride you most want to do. Make sure that you get that done. Then if you are going early like that, I would come away, have a break in the middle of the day, go to a resort. If you're not staying at Disney and you don't want to go all the way back to your hotel offsite, go to a Disney resort and relax. Yeah, cuz that's totally cool. Go around and have a look at the resorts anyway. go to resorts you're not staying at cuz then you yeah just get to see what other Disney places are like and you can sit there for hours if you want to and then go back in the evening. Yeah. And also if you are a deluxe person you get like two extra hours like sort of magic hours in the evening don't you occasionally for Magic Kingdom and Epcot. If you were a deluxe resort guest definitely make the most of that. Um but I would just say yeah go more towards the end of the day. The lines tend to be a bit shorter in my experience. And also maybe as well if you are there for like the two weeks or something you know prioritize. Don't necessarily think you have to go on all the rides every time cuz that's just you're just being cues then like maybe one time if you're in Epcot you could think okay this time I'm going to go to Guardians either first thing or towards the end and maybe another time you're going to do Ratatouille or another time you're going to do Frozen or something and make them the priority. Do you like different ones? Yeah. Can you wish Adian a happy birthday please? Happy birthday, Alian. Tips for being a confident first time Disney vlogger. To be honest, the first time you do it is probably not going to be when you're the most confident. When I go back and watch my first ever vlogs, that was not my most confident. I didn't speak to camera as much. I would feel awkward pulling the camera out in the parks. It is something that gets easier over time and you get more confident at it. So don't put pressure on yourself to like just go and the first time you're ever doing it just be really confident and be totally fine doing everything because that is quite unlikely. I think it takes a bit of practice. So just yeah build build up to it but nobody is going to really care to be honest. Everyone there's so many people that are on their phones and on their cameras anyway. So yeah, no one bats an eyelid. I can feel awkward vlogging back home if I'm in a town center in the UK. I would feel awkward getting the camera out, but I don't hear because no one backs. Everyone has their phones and cameras out all the time anyway. When I started 10 years ago, people did look at you funny and they were like, \"What is she doing? Are you you're like, \"You weirdo.\" Like, I did used to get that a lot. I don't anymore. People are so used to seeing people vlogging. It's just normal now. Uh, right. Let's just do one more and then we will have to get going. Let's just see what we've got here. Has Allstar Sports been noisy at nighttime? No. Nope. Not at all. Categorically, no. Um, we've gone to bed at nighttime, not heard anything, not been woken up by anything whatsoever. And there has been the odd time that we have actually been back at the room like early enough to hear people coming back. I think maybe one time we were back at like 7ish, another time we were back at like 9. So like downstairs in the food court and whatnot, that is crazy busy times. But up in the rooms, I haven't heard a thing. And actually, I did have another question here. Somebody was asking about noise at the Allstars, as in hearing people through the walls. This trip is the least I have heard anything. So, I've had previous trips where I did have one noisy neighbor, a lady who was just quite loud and I could hear her. I think she was on the phone all the time, so I couldn't hear anyone else. Maybe she was just talking to herself. But I'm going to tell myself it wasn't that and she was on the phone, but I would hear her through the walls. Sometimes you can hear people like flushing toilets and things like that. I haven't really heard that this trip. It's been quite quiet. So, I think it depends what room you have. Yeah. And who your neighbors are, but generally speaking, totally not. It was noisier when me and Catherine stayed at the holiday and we had all that construction going on. Be annoying construction. We were waking up at 3:00 a.m. to the sounds of like bin what sounded like a um bin collection lorry or construction. And we Katherine was hilarious. She literally like w and I'm like it's 3:00 a.m. It's not time to get up. She was like, \"Oh my.\" And we had that like every night. So, we haven't had anything like that. It's been really fine. Yeah. We're going to go now and pick up some bits and pieces for the flights. Um, fill the water bottles up and stuff and head towards the gates. It's going to be time to board soon. I hope we can sleep. Me, too. I've got my pillow or Paul's pillow, I should say. If it's really good, I'm going to get a second one for me for when me and him both go. Well, you could borrow mine. I could, but I should probably just get one anyway. But anyway, let's go. [Music] So, I'm just popping back in at the end here to say goodbye. I was going to film an ending to this actually when we got back from Florida, but by the time we got home, I was so tired. Paul obviously very kindly picked us up from the airport and I was just exhausted. So, I didn't film at an ending. So, I thought I would do that.

      "transcript": "I I [Music] take me home today. Take me out. Take me back into sweetness. Good morning everyone and welcome to our last full day here at Disney World. I can't believe it. We were saying this morning it has gone so quickly this trip. Yeah, it really has. It really, really has. So, we are here this morning though. This is super exciting to go to Beak and Barrel which is the new pirates tavern. I have been looking forward to this. I probably have been looking forward to this the most actually. I think our Oh, really? Yeah. I mean with and Starlight Parade. Both of those two things. And this is right at the end of the trip. So, we have had to wait the whole trip to get to do this. And also this morning we are going to get to ride Tron. We've got a lightning lane and the new overlay. That's cool. Yeah, the new overlay started yesterday. The new the Tron Aries I think it's called. And it's like different lighting, music from 9in nails. And I'm just excited to see what that's going to be like. After that, we're going to be heading to the boardwalk and eating at the cake bake restaurant. Last time me and Catherine couldn't get in. We did eat in the actual bakery, but not the restaurant, so that's going to be good. [Applause] I can hear the train in the background. It's just the sounds in the Magic Kingdom more than anything. Although just saying that makes me a tiny bit upset for not hearing the Liberty Bell anymore. I wish they would just pipe in the sound somewhere around Liberty Square. Maybe where the bell is in the middle. Could they not just pipe in the sound? That would be good, wouldn't it? Just if they had it faintly so it's like it's in the distance or something. That would be so good. I wish they do that cuz I do already miss that sound in the Magic Kingdom. Just got to take in every moment of this when it's your last time in the Magic Kingdom. [Music] [Applause] [Music] I really wanted to catch the end of that, but we are going to be late for Beacon Barrel, which is not allowed. They definitely could give away our spot because it's so popular at the moment. So, we're going to head over there now. I'm really excited for this. They have a breakfast bagel sandwich. Sausage, egg, and cheddar served in a bagel. That's similar to what you can get over at the Main Street Bakery in the Starbucks location. Yeah. And it looks like they only have that at the moment. So, the spring rolls must come along a bit later. Ah, here we are. Every time you walk, you go back to town. Welcome to the party. Fire. [Applause] Our table is cool as well. Yeah. So, one thing to note, this is very much like OG's cantina. So, you may not be sitting. So, some of it is standing either at the bar or like we are standing at this really cool table. Love this. But yeah, you're not necessarily going to get a seat. If you needed to for some reason, you would have to ask for that and you probably would have to wait a reasonable amount of time to actually get a seat. But we're just excited to be here and don't mind standing. It's all good. Before we leave from here, I will take you around to have a look at the rest of it. So, this is the menu. And it's quite a small menu. Like I said, it is a bar experience. It's not any kind of like although when you make your reservation, it says lunch. It isn't somewhere where you would get a full meal. 45 minutes and you can do two drinks because there are so many people who want to come here. They have to limit the time so that as many people can get to experience it as possible. In terms of snacks, they have island provisions which is a flatbread corn tortillas and then you get mango chutney chur. So I guess that's like dips basically dips with flatbread and tortillas. Then you've got the corn griddle cakes either with chicken or just vegetable. And I'm going to get that I think. And then they have Kraken's Catch, which is octopus tentacles. Wow. Definitely not to get on that. And then they have non-alcoholic specialty beverages. Claire is getting the Cursed Treasure, which she said is a bit like an Oreo milkshake. And I'm getting the Treasure Trove. So, we're going to try both of those. Our drinks have arrived. The light is a little bit weird in here, so apologies for that. This is Cla's kind of like Oreo milkshake basically flavor. That looks a bit like marshmallows. I'm not sure if it is. Yeah, looks good. And this is mine, which is a lemon and coconut concoction is the drink. But look at this with a treasure on the side, which is very exciting. We've got some popcorn here. I think this is like a cake pop. And I think that's supposed to be a cannibal, but it is a cannonball. That's what you're supposed to be launching at the people next to apparently. I'm supposed I am not doing that. I'm going to eat it. I definitely am not going to launch it. I would much rather eat it. They've been told to do it back to you. No, can't waste it. Okay, let's try this drink. That's really nice. I would say it's more lemony than coconuty. I'm not getting a strong coconut taste, which I'm glad about. It's more just like a nice refreshing lemon drink. Let's see about these bits of treasure. So, the popcorn that tastes like the Worther's popcorn that you get in the Germany pavilion. Very similar to that. Let's see about the cannibal. I am going to eat it. This be plantains, blue chips, flatbread, and for dips. It's plantains, blue chips, flatbread, and for dips. So, this is almost like a chocolate cake pop inside. It's like really dense. Let's try this one. This looks very exciting. And that's basically like a vanilla cake pop as well. The best one is the cannonball. Our server is hilarious, by the way. very much. Repeat after me. [Applause] The main secure Hallelujah. [Music] My goodness. Here [Music] is the corn cake. That looks so good. [Music] I did get a little bit of heat then. Yeah, I know. I've been pulling mine out. I just spotted a chili. To be fair, it's not super hot, but I did just get a little bit of chili there. I didn't like that. It's really good, though. It's got loads of like filling in it. There's lots of corn in here and cheese. This is good. I would highly recommend this. What a great experience this has been. We haven't been able to say everything that we want to say about it because you do get a short amount of time, but we're going to do a full debrief on this later, but it really, really has been amazing. Definitely want to try and get reservation for if you can. It is hard to get, but totally worth it. Yeah, we absolutely loved that. That was so great. That was good. Really good. There's loads of people waiting there now, so maybe an early reservation would be quite good. I think in future when it gets less popular, you might be able to spend a little longer in there, but at the moment they have to limit you because otherwise not very many people will get to experience it. But it was really fun. We talked to some really nice people. Our server Diaz was brilliant. Yeah, he was great. Yeah, he really was. So amazing. Perfect. To be fair though, if you are standing up the whole time like we were, you don't really want to be there for more than 45 minutes anyway. No, you wouldn't want to be there. If you sat down, then you probably would be happy to stay longer. But I was good with that. Like we had enough time to eat and drink and chat. It felt like enough time. Definitely. So now we're going to go to Tron because our window is open for our lightning lane. Tron and full tummy isn't necessarily what I would normally choose. Yeah. Hopefully the hopefully Tron and the grilled corn cake do cooperate. Um, but we'll see what happens. We did do a lightning lane for today because I knew that this overlay was starting yesterday. And I'll put on screen how much we paid for it. I can't remember what it was for today for the Lightning Lane, but it wasn't too bad. And we definitely wanted to make sure we experienced this before we head over to the boardwalk. And I haven't done Tron yet this trip. Just trying on the Mickey glasses. You know, these ones, they were really popular and very sold out everywhere for a while. They are quite cool. I do like them. I want to try them on and see what I think of them as well. Just passing by. So, we had to get a little castle moment. Absolutely stunning. And the castle will be getting a makeover and going back to the blue and cream colors. I'll put in a photo of what it used to be like before it had the 50th anniversary makeover. They're going to be repainting it. I'm not sure when that's happening, but I get the impression it might be fairly soon. I've never noticed these before. These pumpkins and gourds here in the bushes by the tree on Main Street. Never spotted those before. It's time for Tron. And I can't really see any like lights or anything happening yet, but it is daytime, so I think anything like that would be hard to see. But yeah, I'm really interested to see what's what's different or what feels different. Oh, I love when the cast members do this. [Music] The standby is 45 minutes. Very excited for this. We'll let you know afterwards what it's like. Obviously, I cannot film on this ride. [Music] Oh, look at this. Really looking forward to this now. Oh my gosh, that was so good. I absolutely loved that. It was amazing. It always is anyway if you get a chance to do that. I don't know how long it's sticking around, but I would definitely try. I found Cla because she rode on the regular seat. So, you were done a lot quicker than me, weren't you? How was it? Yeah, it's a great ride anyway. It It could be done. Once you get towards the end, I almost think there should be another like burst and off you go. It is a bit too short. That's the only thing that's a shame, but it is a great ride. Yeah. Yeah. Guardians is longer and that's another reason that I love Guardians. It is. It really is though, isn't it? Yeah. But Sean is is amazing. It's just quite a quick ride. And now we're going to go on the people mover. We don't have a lot of time until we need to leave to go across to Boardwalk. Presented by Enterprise. I'm Corak 5, your guide aboard this highway in the sky. The absolute best way to see Tomorrowland. Your express train keeps on rolling into the future. Right by two of my favorites. I am just going to try this lemonade and then we're going to go on Carousela Progress cuz Cla still hasn't done that ever. Have you? No. Never. So, brand new thing. And then we will be walking out to go to the boardwalk. I got the team blue lemonade. So, because this is close to Tron, they've got a special lemonade. That is just like a slush puppy in the UK. You know, the blue slush puppy, how it used to be when you're a kid. That's what it tastes like. I do really, really like that. I love the mango peach refresher, which Cla's got. They did have that here as well. We thought it was just Epcot, but yeah, they do have it. I love both. Joffrey's drinks have been the one on this trip. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. M and I get annual passhold aer discount there as well. So we've had way more Joffre this trip than than Starbucks and I've been loving their kind of cold drinks. I think that's what you'll probably carry on doing. Oh yeah, definitely. Right, let's have this and then Carousel Progress. Carousel of Progress, by the way, is getting refurbished as well. I don't know exactly what they're doing. Just a bit of an update, a refresh. I don't think they're going to be totally changing it because they want to keep it true to Walt's original, but um yeah, I don't know when that's happening as well, but we want to ride it this one time before they make any changes. [Music] Millions of people came to see it and since then the Carousel of Progress has had more performances than any other stage show in the history of American theater. And when it becomes a reality it's a dream come true for you and it's another Halloween here in the fabulous 40s. Everything is better than ever now. great big beautiful tomorrow at the end of every day. Love that. And I just love anything that was created by Walt and I know it's going to be getting updated, but I really am happy that we saw it that time just in case that starts anytime soon. It's just really cool to think that it's it was Yeah. The fact that it's made by him, his his complete idea and design and it's obviously not like a thrill ride or anything, but it also is like it's got some funny bits in it, hasn't it? Yeah. And it's nice for some air conditioning and a bit of relaxing if you've overdone things, which apparently my back is telling me that I have. So, we're now going to walk out. Anyway, we need to get the bus to the boardwalk for our reservation at the Cake Bake Restaurant. I'm really looking forward to this. Like I say, when I tried the dessert there from the walk up bakery section, it was really nice, but I'm really interested to see what the actual restaurant is like. What did you get before? I had the key lime pie and it was absolutely to die for. And I can hear Festival of Fantasy going through as well. you can see a bit. But that is going to be it for Magic Kingdom for this trip. So, last little look. And you've got Festival of the Fantasy going on. I love the boardwalk so much. It's such a nice area. And at this time of day, it's not too busy. A lot of people are in the parks, so you can just come for a nice relaxing stroll. There's loads of different places to get food. There's the pizza window here. You've got the boardwalk deli. There's ice cream next door. There's all these little kiosks. And then you have the cake bake restaurant at the end which is where we're going. But you can get just the desserts from the bakery kind of walk up place which is on the right hand side. They do have a sign here just saying about their breakfast. They do warm breakfast sandwiches, pastries, coffees, lunch and dinner. They got sandwiches, salads, and sweet treats. It's nice in there. And you can also refill your mug in there as well. Oh, that's handy. Yeah. So yeah, this is the bakery where you can just walk up and grab something. It's very beautiful in there. But we will be going sparkly. It's very sparkly. Everything is very sparkly in here. Oh, wow. Hi. Thank you. It is so fancy in here. It is like incredibly special. It's very beautiful. I'm going to turn the camera around in a second. You can kind of see behind me though as well. It is lovely. Like if you wanted to come somewhere special. This is absolutely been in here before? No. Okay. So, you don't know whether or not these decorations are seasonal? I think they are cuz when Catherine and I came they were more like springy. Yeah, that's what I mean. This looks very autoutuminal and like fitting but beautiful. So nice. Let me show you. Look behind Claire here. They've got all of these autuminal decorations and kind of all around the room. But this is just such a fancy room. Behind me there's almost like a round booth that you could be in. So yeah. You could sit in here. I think that I mean I don't know if you'd like to pay a bit more, but like if you were in the middle there, you'd feel the fanciest person ever. Yeah, there's a chandelier in there. It's just stunning. There is so much to choose from on here. This is just the non-alcoholic drinks. They've got all kinds of different coffees, teas, and then other soft drinks there. Then at the back, there's loads of cocktails and sparkling wines and stuff. And in terms of food, I have heard amazing things about the truffle fries and the server did recommend that as well. So, I feel like I might have to have something that involves those. Their salads are supposed to be really nice as well. They have a lemon Caesar salad, a blackberry avocado, and a green goddess cob salad. He recommended the Croc Monsure sandwich. Croc Madame, which has got egg on it, I believe. I think I'm going to get the broccoli kiche with the truffle fries. I am preemptively having a little look at the dessert menu. I don't think I would be able to manage one of the slices of cake. I mean, we could probably share one, but I didn't get one of those last time cuz they are huge. They are massive pieces of cake. They're kind of pricey. They're like $22. I probably will end up getting one of the um key lime pie slices because that was honestly just one of the best desserts I've ever eaten in my life. It was absolutely delicious. I think if you come here like on a Saturday or Sunday morning for like breakfast or brunch, I would imagine it would be very busy in here. We've come here at like 300 p.m. So, I would give that piece of advice actually when you're at Disney. We did our character meals at like 2 3:00 p.m. And then it's very quiet, so it's really nice. You can kind of be quite chilled and there's not a lot of noise, which is nice. It's a little bit of a shame about the lighting in here cuz it is literally making me look like a ghost, but there's nothing I can do cuz it's got a glass ceiling. But let's try this coffee, which is a latte. And I went for marshmallow syrup. That is nice. It's sweeter than I'm used to. Normally I do just drink coffee as it is, but that is Does it have like a marshmallowy taste? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not just sweet. It I can taste actual marshmallow. And you should try your little doughut thing. Yeah. On the side there is a little what looks like a cinnamon doughnut hole. It actually looks like a mini scotch egg if I'm talking about what it looks like on the camera, but it is actually I think mini cinnamon donuts. Let's try this. That is really nice. Yeah, I like that. We've just realized my ears are making like a disco ball. Can you see it on the chair here? Can is in the whole restaurant literally like it's behind Cla. If I go like this, I'm like a human disco ball girl. Maybe I should take No, definitely don't hit. If anyone comes and sits and it's like in their eyes or something, I definitely will. We've just received our food and this is a huge portion. I will say, although on the menu things may appear pricey, the portions are massive. So, this is my kiche, and this is the thickest slice of kiche I think I have ever seen. A huge pile of truffle fries. Claire went for the baratha and it's like two huge pieces of baratha. Masses of tomatoes and like a whole baguette worth of bread with the pesto in the middle. That does look so nice. Yeah, it does. That will be delicious. Yeah. And I think I've got some kind of garlic, mayonnaise, and ketchup here for the fries. This just looks so good. Oh my gosh. I'm just trying the kiche on its own without any of the fries. [Music] Tasty. Mhm. It's really hot as well, like temperature. Okay. And the top almost looks like it's overdone, but it's just like a crunchy top. It'd be good to try some a bit more of the pastry. M. Let's just try a truffle fry as well. M. Those truffle fries are next level good. How's yours? Delicious. Yeah. It's nice to have um something that feels really fresh. Do the tomatoes like feel really Are they flavorful? Yeah, they're lovely. And the um the pesto is really nice. One thing I will say with the kiche though, it's not very cheesy. Oh, really? No, it's very nice. Like it's delicious. I'm just taking a look at the dessert menu now. And when I was here last time with Katherine, just from the bakery, I had the key lime pie. Cla's getting it because I've obviously talked it up so much. What do I do? Keep watching and you'll find out what decision I made. [Music] Oh, that's good. Right. It honestly, it is just Oh, it's actually lighter as well than I was expecting, which is really good because then it means I can eat more of it. And we already know that I'm obsessed. But let's just try this. Is my favorite. Is it as good as you remember? Mhm. Just before we leave, I wanted to show you the whole restaurant from over here. Look at this. Okay, I'm all done with the live stream now and it is raining really, really hard outside. There's a thunderstorm I can hear and lightning going and everything happening. But I am cozy here in the Boardwalk Hotel in the lobby and I thought I would answer a few questions while I'm here, especially now it's raining. I was going to head out to Epcot. Claire is there. I think she is in Creations Shop sheltering from the rain. She said um it is really, really heavy. So, I don't know if I'm actually going to head over there. My back is really, really painful. I'll be honest. Um, and I think it's just going to be too much. And now that it's pouring down, I definitely don't think I'm going to. So, I thought I would answer some of your questions instead. Mom in the middle was asking, \"How easy is it to get from Disney hotels to Universal? Are they close by?\" It's really easy to get between them using Uber. That is the best way. Oh my gosh, I can see so much lightning happening. Yeah, Uber is the best way to get between Disney and Universal. I would say probably the cost is going to be around $25 though if you're just doing the odd day. So, say you're staying at Disney and you're going across to Universal a couple of times during the trip, then it's probably not too bad. But, I wouldn't recommend staying at Disney and going over to Universal most days or vice versa. Katherine and I did stay over at Endless Summer once and then we were coming over to Disney most days. We were sharing the cost of Ubers, so it wasn't too bad, but that did end up being quite pricey with Uber. So, I probably would only plan to do that a couple of times. Love Joe Handmmaid is staying Springs area hotel for one night preWalt Disney World stay. What would you recommend? I would probably go for the Windham. There's the Windham Garden or I think just the Windham. It is the same hotel, but they have like a garden wing or the tower. So, if it says Windham Garden, then it will be in the wing kind of on the side, which I have stayed in loads of times. It's one of the closest to Disney Springs. You can just walk along. it is right there. And they do have bus transportation then across to Disney as well. But I've always found that one really good and it's a very good price as well. Just be aware there will be resort fees in a lot of the offsite hotels. So a lot of the ones along Hotel Plaza Boulevard, which is right by Disney Springs, they do charge resort fees. So just be careful of that cuz it can considerably bump up the cost of your per night price of your hotel. Eliza is asking, \"What's the weather like?\" Well, right now you may even be able to hear that rain. This is absolutely a massive heavy downpour thunderstorm going on right now. Um, we haven't had loads of rain though in fairness. We had a little bit at the beginning of the trip, a couple of showers. This time of year, you do get a lot of rain, a lot of thunderstorms, sometimes even hurricanes and stuff. This is the time of year for it. But mostly it has been quite hot the last few days. What I'm used to for September, I would say, cuz it really can be quite hot still in September. But I would say actually the first four, five days of the trip, so the first half, we did have some days or evenings especially that were quite cool. When we were watching the Starlight Parade in the Magic Kingdom for example, there was such a cool breeze. It actually did feel almost bordering on like chilly, dare I say it. I would didn't find it chilly, but some people probably would have done. So yeah, there has been a couple of random little cooler evenings, but generally speaking, quite hot and some showers, which is typical for this time of year. How was Beacon Barrel? So, I can tell you about this now. In last week's episode, I couldn't because I still hadn't done it, but we actually did that this morning. It was absolutely brilliant. I will say I knew it was going to be good. I hadn't really looked into it too much or watched too many people's things on Instagram or YouTube. I wanted to experience it for myself. It really was fun. It definitely does feel like a pirates tavern. You've got some people standing, some sitting, so be aware of that when you do have a reservation. And there is no guarantee of seating. It's just such a fun atmosphere. There was like random things going on, some singing going on. Our server Diaz was absolutely brilliant. Like he was so in character. He made the experience what it was. I cannot say enough about him. He was absolutely great. Um yeah, we really really enjoyed it. Pink Magnolia Tree is saying, \"Do you make room requests? I'd like to get a super quiet room for a solo allstar sports day.\" Um I actually don't very often make room requests. Very occasionally I would, but usually I just take pot luck and see where I end up. If you're in a preferred room, you are going to be in one of those closer buildings to the lobby. Those I would say are not going to be the quietest though, um, because you will have just a lot of people walking through, walking past cuz they are the closest to the lobby. So really, if you want quiet, I would request the area at Allstar Sports where the tennis area is at the back. I'm not sure what building number that is, but it's like the tennis section. I would say it's probably quite quiet back there. And if you actually mention that you are looking for somewhere quieter, they'll probably put you like around the back where the main walkway kind of isn't there, if that makes any sense. And then you won't get people walking by as much. Maybe go for an upper floor as well rather than a ground floor, cuz then you'll get less people walking by than you would on the ground. Just do a couple more while I'm sat here. Oh my gosh. I don't know if you guys will have seen that. That was a massive flash of lightning. I am going to probably get an Uber back to Allstar Sports after this cuz I need to go back and pack um because we are going home tomorrow and I'm just waiting to see if this rainies is off. Obviously, I'll be finding the Uber. But walking from the Uber to my room, I don't want to get soaked. It's just nice and cozy in here. I don't really want to move. Jazzy is asking any plans to visit any of the Asia parks soon. I do really Oh, someone's just opened the door. Can you hear that? That is so loud. That is some heavy rain. Um, any plans to visit any of the Asia parks soon? Yes, I really, really want to go back to Tokyo, Disney. I'd like to do them all. So, I'd like to do Shanghai and Hong Kong as well. Um, me and Paul definitely want to go out and see my brother in South Korea. He actually met my brother this summer and they got on really well and really liked each other. We want to go out there and see my brother and his wife. And if we do that, we definitely would then go over to Tokyo because it's like a two-hour plane ride and it would seem crazy not to when we're going that far. Um, so Tokyo will probably be the next one that we'll do again. And it was 2018 that I went, so it has been quite a while. I really, really can't wait to do it again. We only had a couple of days. Next time I would go for slightly longer, so we had maybe 2 days in each park. That would be ideal because we were a bit rushed last time. They've now got Fantasy Springs and all of the new stuff. So, definitely Tokyo Disney. Maybe next year. I would love to do that. Okay, I'll do a couple more and then Cla and I will do the rest tomorrow on our going home day cuz there are a lot of questions here that you guys asked Cla or ones that I just know would be good for both of us to answer. Hannah is asking what would be the best character dining with an infant. I think probably Crystal Palace. I would say um I just really think that they would probably love the Winnie the Pooh characters. They're just so cute. And Magic Kingdom is a park as well that young children would really really enjoy. And I just Yeah, I could see that that would be really nice. So, I think probably I would say Crystal Palace. They're all really good. Some of them are a little bit more hectic than others, though. So, I would maybe try and go to Crystal Palace and go around 2 2:30 p.m. I think that'd be a really nice experience for little children. Someone is asking here, will I go to Disney with my mom again? I would love to do another Disney trip with my mom, and I know that she would really like to come back as well. So, that's something that we've got in the planning. We're definitely trying to figure out getting my mom to come again. She loved it so much, and I know she'd love to do another trip. K Dreaming is saying, \"Have you been able to see any of the new lands being built at Magic Kingdom? Can you see any progress?\" You can't really see an awful lot yet. In one of the vlogs that will have already happened, it was probably our very first day actually in the Magic Kingdom. So the first vlog from this trip, we did kind of go by where Liberty Bell was and we could see that the Liberty Bell has gone and you could see the kind of track where it would have gone around. I guess just clearing kind of progress, but you really can't see anything happening just yet in terms of construction. I'm sure big walls will be going up there soon, so you can't really see anything, but you will have seen what there is to see in the first vlog because we did take a look at that. Before I leave the boardwalk though, I have to show you the creepiest chairs in Walt Disney World. They are quite literally part of the furniture at the boardwalk and have been for so many years. So, they're creepy, but we love them. I will just show you this rain. Look at this. Look at it pouring from the roof there. It's completely soaked the grass over there and people are like winging through it. Just give you a last look at this resort though. It's so beautiful. Oh, I love it. The water over there, just underneath the helmet, it's flooded. That's normally the way that I would go in. Let's go around this way to try and get to the lift. That shows you how much it's rained and my shoes are squeaking. Look, you can see it better here. It's like a lake. I am back at the room now. I made it back without having to swim. You would not believe honestly like the ground everywhere was just so wet. When I was seeing those people running through the boardwalk like coming up to the hotel, there was just water like sloshing everywhere and you saw like the flooded bit where the football helmet is at this hotel. Cla said when she came back that had actually dispersed a little bit. It wasn't quite as bad as that, was it? No. So, it had obviously drained. We've been back a while now. Uh we've packed almost everything. So, there are a few bits still to put in in the morning. I'm really hoping my luggage is not going to be too overweight. Um, Cla might have a bit of weight limit left in hers. So, when we get to the airport, we'll just have to see what happens. Mine is not about space. It is just about the actual weight of it. Um, but it's been a nice last day today. I feel like it started very early, so Beacon Barrel feels like feels like that could be a different day even. But, it was nice to do that. I've been really really wanting to experience that since I saw that it was opening and it was great. I've got my pajamas on. This is actually a t-shirt I got in the outlets. Look, it's the um Disney Eats range and it's got all the snacks like in a Mickey head design. I'm not 100% sure whether this will be the end of the vlog or whether it will roll into tomorrow. Tomorrow getting sorted out to go home. We're going to be going to Disney Springs, eating at Homecoming. We will be going to World of Disney because I need to get a couple of gifts and things for people. But thanks for watching so far, but stay tuned because there will be more. [Music] Our last meal of the trip. It's really cool in here. I do love it. This is a very popular restaurant here at Disney Springs. [Music]"

      "transcript": "Hello you guys and welcome to Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party and we are so excited to be here. So let's go ahead and get checked in, get our wristbands, and go have a very merry time. With Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party, it is a separately ticketed event. And with your ticket, you can enter as early as 400 p.m. But for us, we are kind of coming in a little later. The party officially starts at 700 p.m. So, we decided to take a break, relax, do a little bit of resting and napping back in the room before we headed out. And we're going to check in. And it's almost 6:00. This side of the regular mission this side right here. So, day guests are officially ending at 6:00. So, they've got about 10 minutes, but they are directing everyone over here. And the nice part about coming later is you don't have that big rush. Let's go check in. Got your band. I love it. Oh. Oh, okay. All right. Thank you so much. Have fun tonight. And don't forget your wristbands. Okay. Oh, yes. Absolutely. All right. Don't pull it tight, though. Don't pull it. If you pull it too tight, then it'll be overly tight. Thank you. Okay, just a second. Thank you so much. Very merry Christmas party. Once you enter, they are going to direct you to the right side. This is a special entrance where they usually give away the free ornament typically is what they are handing out for you. So, if you are going to want your free gift, definitely go this way. But if you're like us and you need a peppermint mocha drink afterwards to kind of caffeinate for the night, you can double back when you get to the end of this. It's going to take you out right between the plaza restaurant as well as the bathrooms there for Tomorrowland Terrace restaurant. Jingle bell for you. Thank you so much. You too. Now down this little alleyway. Well, they are giving out your free treats and things. See what we got here? Merry Christmas. Thank you. Come on. A little peppermint marshmallow. Cute. All right. In this way though, you are going to have some special character meet and treat. So, we've got the gingerbreads over here. Up to the left. You've got the angel, which honestly right now the wait times are not bad considering this was a soldout party. These this line is really small. Now the ging bag is a little bit longer probably going to be maybe a 20 30 minute wait. I would say for the angels they are going to be probably about 10 minute wait. All right. So we are hanging a left here at Plaza cuz we want to go caffeinate. That is one of the best things to do is both caffeinate and eat and grab maybe some dinner before the party officially starts. That way you are ready to go and you don't have any hangry monsters getting in the way of you enjoying the party specifically. There is definitely a line for Starbucks. People are running to get a warm beverage cuz it is currently 56 outside but it feels like 46 with the windchill. All right. So, there's six cookie stations. So, telling you, look, six different cookie spots. That's a lot of cookies. That is a lot of cookies. That looks yummy. We should get one. Got to get that picture. You're not on the Holly jelly. Say sugar cookie latte. How lovely you are. Thank you. Oh my goodness. Mommy, you're amazing. I I said vent, but I think you misunderstood. So, you got a grande. I owe you a coffee. You owe me. Be careful. All right, there's a show going on. Let's go see if we can catch some. Sounds good to me. This tastes like a cookie. It's just melted inside the cup. It's delicious. Oh my gosh. Not balloon. So cool. It's lighting up. Oh, just a quick heads up for those that might be new to the party, these photo spots are up all day long, even during regular park hours. And there's also photographers there then. So to save yourself time when you're coming to the Christmas party, don't do that. Visit that one during the day if you're coming another time to Magic Kingdom. You want to do that? It was awesome. The child that didn't want to do Monster Think Show the other day is now like, \"Let's go do Mike Wisowski. That was awesome.\" Can I get a refill for this in one of the red truck popcorn buckets? Thank you so much. We're getting this one. Back up. Back up. Back up. Look at this. Oh, look at this. It's got a hinge. That's so cool. It does not. Hold it together. Give it to Lucy. And if you need to know, the front opens, too. Lucy saw a hinge. And so you squeeze No, they're happily sharing. Popcorn bucket acquired. Also, if you're coming and you want the party exclusive popcorn bucket, this one as well as the one um over by the Liberty Bell, there's some of the out of the way popcorn stations, not just the ones by the castle, also have this. So, it was a lot shorter line to come here than it was by the castle. And also, you do have to show your wristband, so be ready for that. And right now, because it's after 6 to get on any attraction, you do have to show your wristband. Ready? Big jump. Woo! I got you. Just stop. What does delay mean? The castle. There you can. It's going to be on soon. They've got the rest of them coming on. Feel like Tron should have a Christmas overlay, too. That would be so cool. Yeah. Red. Wow, look at all the lights and the wreaths. So pretty. So, there are five attractions that have Christmas overlays here at the Magic Kingdom, but four of them are party exclusives. One being Monsters Inc., Space Mountain is another, Tomorrowland Speedway is the third, and Teacups is the fourth. So, they're all in this little radius. So, we're hoping to knock out the four of those really quickly, and then we'll see what else kind of party stuff we can get into. house break here ringing me singing when I hear the ring under the tree good dancing. I like it. over here. We got up here. All right, everybody. All right, Space Mountain time says 35minut wait and it is 7:04. So let's give it a shot. This adventure expectation. Yeah, boy. Yeah. Yeah. What a beautiful ride. All right. 7:35 headed to find the f those awesome. This is what happens when Dean leaves us alone. The girls talked me in to face paint. So, they have some special ones for Christmas. They range anywhere from $28, which this is the one the girls are getting. Holly Magic to $30. So, they've got Christmas ghost for the rain sparkle. It's it's $30. So, got a few different ones, but yep, we're getting face paint. Dude, look at all that gold. Oo, pretty. Gold. Yeah. Me, too. You have some red sparkles. Yeah, me too. That was so much fun. And here is a quick check-in of the wait times at 7:19 just after the party started. After a minor derailment, after a bathroom break for face paint. Now we're going to go ride Speedway. My face paint. It's so pretty. I love it. Now to ride Speedway. Giving them hot chocolate at the very first of the party is wild time. But we've got energy. So hopefully we just don't have the crash at the end. All right, hop on in. Thank you. All right, are you ready? Are you ready? Yeah. Let's do this. Hey, we're going to go get on number one. Where you stop? Where your stop? What? Where your stop? What? Stop. Oh, my stop. Yeah. Race track. Okay. Turn. You go in first. You ready? Yeah. Woohoo. We get to go drive around and look at Christmas lights together. It's going to be so fun. Look at him. So pretty. Oh my goodness. Okay, I'm not driving a car. I did not get into one of these self-driving cars. I don't know how I feel about those yet. Okay. And don't for I'm a little bit of a traditionalist. That scares me. We're almost catching up to Daddy and Susie. We're getting on him. Excuse me, ma'am. You look a little young to be driving. Oh, mommy's catching up. Whoa. Hey, slowpoke. Don't stay. Let's go. Yeah. We're almost to the place. The driver behind us trying to hit us. Road rage. All right, let's not have road rage in the habit. The most magical place on earth or have snow. Obvious magical. We'll get it right in a minute. No road rage. No road rage at Magic Kingdom. That's not good. We're almost to the race. Thank you, driver. She's She's going to safely get me to the racetrack. Oh my goodness. Somehow some way she got us back safe. Let's go. All right. No. Are you sure? It is 8:00. We have knocked out two of the party exclusive attractions as well as hit up one of the two dance parties that we wanted to. So, we're going to keep it moving. I want to grab some cookies really quick. We want to do Monsters Inc. and we'll see what else we can get into. We're trying to hold off on meeting some of the characters until the very first parade, which is at 8:30. So, I'm hoping between the tree lighting or the castle lighting at 8:15 with Anna and Elsa. And then also with the parade, first parade being at 8:30, we will be able to go and sneak into some of the character meet and greets with a little bit less lights maybe. Hopefully, fingers crossed. Oh my word. This is the Cosmic Grace cookie line. It's wrapped all the way outside and all the way to teacups. I'm not sure I have seen a line for cookies that long. That is wild. Usually, we just walk in even on sold out nights for these parties. Like, I guess it's just early. I don't know. Maybe we'll have to hit them late. The lunch pad cookie spot with the red velvet cookies are a lot less busy. So, we have red velvet cookies here as well as cider. I will say this one has multiple lines. We just noticed that, but we're already kind of in this one. We're not too far away. But there's multiple ones all the way around this. So, look for the shortest lines. They're even close to the Astro Orbiter, there's a line. Thank you so much. We got our cookies. All right, let's go. Cookies in hand and we are heading in to the bathroom. Velvet cake cookie. Ooh. All right. Ready? A little chilly, huh? You want to try the cookie? What do you think? You want me to open yours? Okay. You like it? You got to eat it fast though. Okay. Is that good? Red velvet cake. Yum. Oh, I just wanted the cookie. Oh, I didn't cook. I'll trade you. I was going to trade you. The apple cider was good. It's basically just It just tastes like apple juice with uh cinnamon in it. And it was delicious. It was cold. I don't know if it's supposed to be cold. It's delicious, though. Go the last row. Go all the way across. All the way across. Thank you. people. It's the most wonderful time of the year. You got horns or tentacles or fur, you're celebrating with the ones you love. And we got to tell you, we love our holiday host. You guys know him. He's round and green with one eye. Shout out his name. Wasowi. If you love that Mike Wazowski, yell Mike. Mike. That concludes our mic check. Look, we got some jingle locks. Back here is an expert in the holiday traditions of the human world. What? I know the human traditions that the humans celebrate for their traditional human holidays. Okay. Um, test you. Let's talk to a human and find out where they live and what they celebrate. It could be anyone. Okay, hold on. Anyone except for that guy. He's a crispy cookie crew. He's busy. He loves cookies. You know what else he does? He sees you when you're sleeping. He knows when you're awake. He's watching. He's always watching. Here we are. Smile. We are beautiful. Now I say bye. Bye Judy. 2 minutes. Bye. Bye. Thank with us Judy house. That was more fun than it should be. Wow, that was fun. I love the dance parties. They're so cute. It was a good time. Bella's like, \"I'm ready to get back to do some popcorn.\" She said, \"Give me that popcorn, Mom.\" And I was like, \"Lucy, please dance with me.\" And she's like, \"Nah, I'm good.\" I said, \"I'll pick you up.\" And she goes, \"Yeah.\" Yeah. She was the one wanting to run to the front of the stage. We'll get over there. I'm going to stay in here. It's like, you can't be a statue on the dance floor, girl. You got to move it. I'm a I'm a stage wallflower. Lost the bottle of water somehow. Lost the bottle of water. She said, \"Watch out.\" I'm a mama on a mission. No running at Disney. I know. I'm speeding. I'm walking with purpose. Okay. Yeah, baby. Mommy's taking you to meet Stitch. Right. It is 8:52. I can hear the parade, the first parade coming through in front of the castle. Here's an update on weight times. Carousel zero, Orbiter, Barntormer, Dumbo, Small World, Teacup, Magic Carpet, Pirates, Tiana's, People Mover, Under the Sea, Little Mermaid are all five minutes. 10 minutes for Monsters Inc. Speedway Walk on for Haunted Mansion, 15 for Pooh, 25 for Jingle Cruise. Peter Pan is also 25. Mine Train is 25. Space Mountain's 25. Meeting Royal Couples at Fairy Tahal is 30. We've got 35 minutes for Shawn. Friends from Frozen's 40. 45 for Mickey and Minnie. Jack and Sally are at 45 minutes. And Disney Pals are at 55 back at Pete's silly side show. So, usually that was Minnie and Donald, Daisy, and Scrooge. This year it is Donald, Daisy, and Scrooge. And Minnie is actually with Mickey this year, which I'm honestly really excited about. I love the two of them together. So, that is very exciting. But they keep teeter tottering. At one point, they were 25 minutes when we were getting out of Monsters, Inc., but now they've quickly jumped. So, we'll see. There you go. He's ready. so cool. It's empty. They ate all of it. Can you believe it? They ate all the Hi. Bye. Jump it so we can keep going. All right. I'm so glad we found Stitch. Ooh. Cosmic Rays cookie stop. I'm down.

Dad, you give it a shot. How's the cookie? Hot chocolate. your hot chocolate. Sorry, I tried to treat you like a felt that a waiter or waitress like as soon as you put a bite of food in your mouth.

Okay. Go with daddy. Bella says we're in Barntormer World right now. I see the giant candy cane. That means cookie, I think. All right, they got holiday punch and snowman pretzels. Oo. That's yummy. They said holiday punch. I didn't see any punch. I saw pretzels. I was kind of looking forward to some cranberry juice. It was at the exit. I like that. Bella wanted to try it, too. That's very good. Oh, she don't like that. You want to try the pretzel? Ashley's in line to me leaning through right now. Whoa. Jump rope. And we did it. All right. I know that was really cool, but this is so much cooler with a third jump rope. So, I need a brave volunteer. I think we're at the table now. You ready? Magic.

Now, off to find Ashy cuz that last place wasn't a cookie. It was a pretzel and it was delicious. Uh 50 minutes. They're going to go take a honey break and then they're going to come right back. Okay. Didn't get right on and piglet and orange just the fireworks. Had to go take a honey break. I see Tiger. It's Tigger. Woo. Yeah. Want to go see Tiger? Say hi. And Piglet. A Bye. Bye, guys. Thank you. Stroller. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Those fireworks were beautiful. They were beautiful. Cookie stop number three. All right. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Girls, you want some cookies? I want some cookies. A chocolate chip cookie. Oh, I'll take her then. Well, thank you so much. Thank you. All right, we'll get it in just a minute. This is eggnog. Eggnog. You know what? I'll try it. I've never had eggnog. Eggnog. You want to try? I'll try hers, too. Thank you. Thank you. Eggnog, buddy. Thank you. All right, Lucy. Bye. Trying the Thank you. You like the nog? Oh, okay. Let me try. She said e. Bye. Thank you. All right. So, Ash, have you ever had eggnog? No. Yeah, me either. I don't know that I want to start tonight. It never sounds good. No. Like no. I don't know about that. Egg in a drink. I don't know. But I'm going to try it. Hey, that tastes really good. I like that. My mind is like, don't drink it. That sounds awful. Eggnog. But my taste buds are like, hey, that's pretty good. It's like sushi the first time you have it. And you're just like, oh man, this this fish ain't cooked. M chocolate chip cookie. Here we go. That's a chocolate chip cookie. I probably the least good one so far. That's sad. You want to try it? It's like a classic. Yeah, it's okay. Not right. Yeah. All right. This is a really short line for Snow White. I wonder if Snow White's doing autographs. I don't know. It is her and her prince. 10:21. So, just after the fireworks, another weight check in the carousel zero minutes. Astro Orbiter, Barntormer, Dumbo, Small World, Teacups, Magic Carpet, Who Pirates, Tiana's, People Mover, Little Mermaid are all five minutes. Let's see. Monsters Inc., Space Mountain, Tomorrowland are all 10. Haunted Mansion is 13, which means it is a haunted long gone. 20 minutes for mine train, which is honestly insane, even for a party. Jingle Cruise is 25 minutes. Peter Pan's flight's 25. Meeting Royal Couples at Fairy Tale Hall is 30 minutes. And we're in line for Snow White right now, and it's definitely not 30 minutes, but maybe maybe at Fairy Tale Hall it is. They've got the couples kind of spread out a little more this year. For the Frozen Friends, it says it's 40 minutes. For Pete Silly Silly Sideshow, that's like a mouthful. Time twister. 55 minutes. Jack and Sally are back up to 65 minutes. And Mickey and Minnie are at an all-time high of 70 minutes. Not quite the highest we've seen on tonight. It was up at 125, so over 2 hours, but not too shabby. Close is Tron. But we just saw the fireworks. So, I'm having a feeling this is why Mickey and Minnie's wait time is a little elevated right now cuz the fireworks are over. The first parade has happened. So, I'm hoping though that means some of these wait times will drop even more. But, we'll say thank you. Do you have a pen? I noticed these wonderful bows on your head. Oh, wonderful. Yes, you guys will. Yes, we do. Bill, this must be your ide. Of course, Grumpy didn't smile for his portrait, though. How's it going? Wow. So nice, isn't he? Was Sleepy asleep for the photo as well? So, he is asleep in the mine cart right now. Perhaps you're about ready for a nap or two. Well, maybe you need a blanket. One just as soft as my cape. Just soft. Oh, so cozy. Isn't that nice and cozy? Would you like to come cuddle, my friend? Thank you. Wonderful. Thank you. So nice. Say hello. Wonderful. Thank you for joining us, my friend. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mary. Would you like a warm whiskey, too? Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye, my dear. Enjoy the rest of your visit. At least behind the castle. It seems like it is really starting to clear out after sec first parade and fireworks. We want to make it over to maybe Frontier Land area to watch the second parade and be able to squeeze that one in there without having to stake out a spot. Usually for Main Street in front of the castle, you've got to be there 45 minutes to an hour, even with the second parade. So, we'll see. I would love to be on Main Street. It's my favorite with the snow. But I also want to try to squeeze in as much as we can during our party time. So, we'll see how that goes. 25 minutes for Peter Pan is absolutely wild. It's that time of night. It's almost time for the second parade. It is 10:40. So, we're doing our tactical PJs cuz Bella is almost falling asleep. She took a nap, but she's still very tired already. So, she's going to go ahead and probably fall asleep pretty soon. We are in our tactical jammies. We got our jammies on. So, we are set, which makes the transition later a whole lot easier. It was again fantastic for Jollywood night. So, we're just repeating what works. Copy paste. If it works, it works. So, we're not arguing with what works, but we're hoping we've got two more spots to grab cookies from. Tortuga Tavern and Sunshine Terrace. So, I'm hoping to grab those two and then grab a spot to watch the parade. We'll see where we can get. The crowd's not bad, so we might get Main Street possibly, but we'll see. I will say each of the cookie stops has an entrance and an exit. So you want to look for that. So the entrance is over under the frontier lands. Hi. Merry Christmas. It just kind of weaves around through here up to the former quick service location. Merry Christmas. Appreciate it. Thank you. Oh, no. It's so yummy. It is a hot cocoa cookie. Heck yes. More hot chocolate. Probably not. Never mind. She will wake up for hot chocolate. Is it super tasty? Oh, you want We've made it to the final cookie stop and that is the Sunshine Tree Terrace. I am so curious to see I see an orange drink of sorts. Oo. So, let's go see what they got. Hi there. Hi. Thank you so much. You, too. All right. Buttercream frosted gingerbread cookie. All right, it is 10:57. There are a lot of people, and I say a lot, but quite a few, that are booking it over to Main Street. I want my We didn't get the quintessential spot in front of the castle for the fireworks, but I kind of want it for the parade. I'm I was trying to let go of it for tactical reasons, but I I don't think I can, you guys. So, let's see if we can find a spot. Woo! You got to stand behind the yellow line, baby girl. Thank you. I like that. Very nice. We did end up with a pretty good spot here at the walkway right as you enter under the train station. So, we're right here at the tree. So, the parade is going to come right at us. We just have to stay behind this yellow line for now. But, we got a pretty good spot in town square. I will happily take this. I love this area so much. So this this feels like Christmas party. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat up here. It's just a fairy tale living Here, I'll cut it. Why crayons? Wow. I am saying I know. We made it in line for Mickey and Minnie. They're saying it's over an hour. Oh, you are a lollipop professional. I got bigger. Oh, no. No. It's a good thing we have a backup. Yep. Not too shabby. 12:18 almost to the door. One has been revived by a lollipop. Woo! The other one is almost toast. Um, mom said I can have a glow stick. Oh, I just said you could have a glow stick. There you go. Whoa. You got a purple one. How many? I'll take you guys right this way, please. Okay. Merry Christmas. Say hi. Come in. want to get in. Yes, please. Hi. She's been so excited to meet Minnie. Huh? You look good right over here, my little one. Lovely. Don't forget your dog. Awesome. Bye, Minnie. Bye-bye. Have a lovely Merry Christmas party. Byebye. Bye. Have a great trip. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Merry Christmas. That's pretty. One last little bit of party fun. Checking out the Emporium at 12:30 cuz why not? for your room. Yeah, I want this one for my room. For your room? Yes. My room? Yeah. We found the ornament. All right. You want to sit down for our hotel? For our hotel. All right, you guys. As the song says, happy holidays. We have officially shut down the park. I think we're the last guest leaving literally out of this area of the park. So, we have done it yet again. It is 12:58. But this has been a great party. Thank you guys for following along. If you haven't already, don't forget to click that thumbs up button, the red subscribe button if you are new. And now that you are part of our honorary end of the video club, you've got to leave us some Christmas emojis. And I want to know what your very favorite part of the Christmas party is. Whether it's the short lines, the character meet and greets, the parade, the fireworks, whatever it is for you, would love to hear all about it down in the comment section. But we're going to go catch a bus cuz it's late. Heat. Heat. Love Christmas. my mind. Wow."

      "transcript": "Hello you guys and welcome to Jollywood Nights here at Hollywood Studios. While this event is marketed for more of the adult crowd, it is still a family-friendly event since Disney does sell tickets for children as well. But we're going to see what Jollywood Nights 2025 has in store and if it's something that has enough to do for the entire family or if we're going to be hitting the exit a little earlier than expected. But first, let's get a little bit of Jollywood housekeeping out of the way. That way you know exactly what we're talking about. So, Jollywood Nights is a separately ticketed event happening here at Disney's Hollywood Studios, and it is going to run starting on November 8th through December 22nd. And as I'm filming this, none of the other party dates have sold out, which is really not great for Disney's bottom line, but for you as a party guest, it's actually really great. We were at one of the nonsoldout nights last year, and it was fantastic. Tonight, we are here for opening night, and of course, opening night's always sold out. With your Jollywood ticket, you can enter Hollywood Studios as early as 5:30 p.m. and party until 12:30 a.m. the next morning, giving you 7 hours of Holly Jolly Studios fun. Now, if you're a day ticket holder or an annual passholder like a lot of those vlogging the party, you can actually check in inside the parks. But we're doing this as if we aren't annual passholders and only utilizing our Jollywood tickets, which means we're about to go get in this line that is here to open up at 5:30. I'm going to pick the smallest one. Beginning at 5:30 p.m., you can check in at the front gates after going through security. All you have to do is watch for the signs and the cast members, and they'll show you exactly the way to go. [Music] All right. Once you scan your ticket, you'll go through and they are then after that handing out our van. Ready for your band? There we go. Hello. Hi. Thank you so much. Thank you. Have fun. Thank you so much. What? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Thank you. You're welcome. Have a good time. Thank you so much. As you enter into the park, they are going to direct you to the right side. So, we're going in and they've got all the fun Jollywood stuff set up. They've got balloons and photo spots. Usually, these are really busy. So, we'll see what opening night looks like tonight and then we'll go from there. If it's really busy, we'll come back because it's going to be here our all party long. You got the photo spot with the Jollywood sign, but the line is a bit long. So, instead of doing that, we're going to go caffeinate and get ready to party cuz we got 7 hours of fun coming at us. So, it is 5:39 and we are now in the park. They started letting everyone in at about 5:28, so just like a couple minutes before 5:30, and then we were able to move through in about 10 minutes. And now we're on Sunset Boulevard. So, I feel like that's pretty quick. But it's just something to note that if you are wanting to be here right when the park opens, there's going to be a little bit of a line that you're going to be met with outside of the gates. So, a quick glance at wait times at 5:42. So, Star Tours is its classic 5 minutes. Millennium Falcon, we've got 15. Aliens is 25. Mania is 30. Tower of Terror is 30. Mickey and Mini Runaway Railway is also 40. 40 for Rock and Roller Coaster, 40 for Slinky, and 40 for Rise, which is not bad. But I'm hoping these weight times get a little bit better. But tonight's quest is to help you decide whether it's worth the $149 to $189 price tag that comes with a ticket to this event. And I'm going to be honest, I've got some spicy thoughts. When it comes to that 5:30 to 7:30 time frame, you've got about 2 hours to kill before official party things start. So, this is one of those you might want to grab some dinner here in the park, but save room for snacks later on. Or you may want to go ahead and start enjoying some of the attractions that do have lower weight times. There are a few that have some lower ones. And so, depending on what night you come, check the app. And that would be what I would tackle first. Like I mentioned earlier, if you do have day tickets or an annual pass and you're in the park, you can go to the event check-in stations within the park and get your wristbands there. But if you are buying just a party ticket and you're not already using a daytime ticket, you can't enter until 5:30 p.m. like we did. I'm the leader. You're the leader. Okay. Aliens is a posted 15-minute wait, but so far I'm not seeing anyone, so I kind of feel like that's exaggerated. So, let's go take a spin. [Music] All right, our first sign of people. Definitely don't think this is 15 minutes. 2 minutes. Wow, I like that. 15 minutes. That's my faster. Heat. Heat. your attention, please. It seems like there's something following us. What are we going to do? It's an alien. Oh, no. Full speed ahead. Let's go. Woo! Woo! One thing to keep in mind with your Jollywood strategy is the 6:30 sweet spot. So for to us tonight it is 6:30 when they are having fantasmic. So definitely check and see if you're wanting to see the show. It's a great opportunity. If you bought tickets, you want to come, you could absolutely go see that as a Jollywood ticket holder. But you can also go and check out some of the attractions that are lower weight times because day guests are being pulled to that end of the night spectacular. And right now that 6:30 sweet spot's looking pretty good. We've got a 5minute for Star Tours, which it will be that all night honestly. Star Wars Rise of the Resistance is a 10minute wait you guys. Like that's basically a walk-on cuz that queue is so long. Alien Swirling Saucer says it's 15 minutes. We were on in 2 minutes as you guys just saw. Millennium Falcon Smugglers Run has popped up from 15 to 20. So that one may be a little more accurate. Mania's 35. Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway says it's 40. Slinky Dog's 40. Tower of Terror says it's 40. And Rock and Roller Coaster is 45. So not great weight times, but not bad. And honestly, I'm wondering how many of those are inflated. Since we've got a long night ahead of us, though, we're going to do a tactical jaw freeze. We may need to do a second tactical jaw freeze, but we're going to start with one for now. Let's check them out. Let's do this. I'll call him Booger. Booger. You don't want to go see Ogre Booger? Oh, no. I don't want to go see Orele. [Music] Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh. Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sle. Y'all need to stop. That is too cute. We can match. I have a freaking old match. Yeah, I'm an enabler. That's so cute. Look at that pillow. You're tired already. She just wants to wear her new PJs is what she says. Tactical PJs. Yeah. What is that one? This is a small. Yeah, it's definitely an oversized fit. I was going to say that's still oversized. Yeah, I know. I'd probably just go with the small. Yeah, I'll go with that one. That's so cute. So cute. It's bursting in here. I've not seen this collection in any of the stores yet. That's really cute. I'm just wondering with it being chilly the night of our Christmas party at the dress I have is basically this color and I'm wondering if wearing it not if I need something to be worn [Music] jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way to ride in a one-horse open sleigh. Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh. Oh, if you guys have a kid that likes Gertie like we do, the Gertie cookie is over on the left side in front of the theater, but then he goes away and he hides. Where'd he go? If you watch on the right side, he's probably walking. He'll also hop out over here. Him and Olly are kind of jumping around on the screen. So, I guess it's Ollie's turn now. But he does. He pops up right about that yellow present there. Gertie will kind of bust out and say hi. There's Gertie. It took him a second, but he popped back out. It is 7:09 and the park officially closed at 700 p.m. So, they have taken all the wait times out. They'll be popping back in probably at 7:30 when the party officially starts. So, that's what I'm curious to see about these weight times cuz that's where things get spicy. [Music] Wo, so many plants. Oh, this is mine. Oh, that's for you and to share. All of this looks so good. And these are all our tacos. Oh, we love tacos. I know. Hey, put it on the table, baby girl. One's not going to be enough. No, never. Don't put it down. That was the the major disappointment last year is we didn't get two. Yeah, baby. Cheers. Looks yummy. What is it? Look like I remember it. Mhm. I missed you. I love a good taco. [Music] I'm going in for the empanada. [Music] That's yummy. Is there corn on the inside of it, too? There's chicken. M spices. [Music] I don't think it shows up well there, but no corn. Okay. Tastes good though. It just comes with the corn. Okay. I was a little confused by the the final lemon. Now it has corn on the inside. [Music] That's good. You're going to like that. That is good. One thing that is tough is that they a lot of these places aren't serving chicken tindies and mac and cheese. So, be sure to feed your kids a solid dinner cuz like they're okay with the tacos and they're eating. We had them split one for now to see if they liked that enough to want to get more. But chicken tendies and grilled cheeses and all those things really are plentiful during the party cuz it is more adult focused. And the menu is also more adult focused. So, we love it. Oh, it's so good. But it ain't chicken titties. [Music] Good spices, right? That is good. Two more. That's really good. One. Two. I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't that. It's good. That's so good. One. I wish they made this good of food during the regular park day. I would come eat here, but every time we've eaten here, it's been terrible. So, we don't come back. I mean, it's pretty. It's a giant picture cookie. Here you get your taco cookie. Get your taco cookie. Taco. There you go. There's There's your taco cookie. Put all the trimmings on it. I ate the bell. What cinnamon? I don't even know what's on this thing. Chocolate. Cinnamon. I ate the bell and I didn't like it. You didn't like it? Yeah. That's okay. It definitely tastes like Christmas. It's good. I don't like it. That's okay. More. Yeah. Here you go. All right, I'm going to try this. This looks delicious. Can I try the marshmallow? Try one marshmallow. You can have a marshmallow. I need two. You can have a marshmallow. Marshmallow. You can have a marshmallow. A narrow tiny icing, too. I like that one. It's got cinnamon on it. Yeah. Can I try the icing? The top of it. Sure, baby. Okay. I need a bite for me. All right. Give me more. Give me more. You love this part. I kind of as good as it looked. That dessert tasted as good as it looked. I can assure you that. So, I know you got a closeup. You definitely got a closeup. And after you got your closeup, I did end up eating the whole thing. It was good. 10 out of 10. Would would recommend. Don't stick your camera in it though. Not wouldn't recommend that. No, definitely not. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Jolly [Applause] blue steps in and see you [Laughter] [Applause] [Applause] That was pretty cool, huh? Yeah. Yeah. I love it. Do you love the show? Yeah. That was so cool. That was so cool. Oh, found Gertie. I grow myself a beard in time for Christmas. I keep it throughout the year. My baby's just crazy. Show them the ping bong. Is that what you want? The bing bong. Woo! Don't lean on it. It's got wheels. There we go. That looks good. All right, so Lucy wants the bing bong. The micaroon looks really good. And I want the Buffalo chicken spring rolls. So, Buffalo chicken spring rolls from the market. The new baby spring rolls. Cute little baby spring rolls. Do you want to grab one? [Music] Ready? Really good. [Music] That's really good. They are all over. All right. Can you step out of the top? All right. Drink. Drink. Drink. Can I give a try now? The girls got the bing bong slush from the market. The spring rolls are so good. That's good. Oh, that's good. The spring rolls from the market were good. They were actually hot. I think they had those the very first year that we were here. They were okay, but they weren't great. But tonight, they were hot. They were yummy. Had just the right amount of spice with the buffalo. It was so good. The girls are loving their bingong slushie. It is a strawberry frozen slushie topped with cotton candy. Rex. So, we are now joining the line for Cardiosaurus Rex. Kind of see. Doesn't look terrible. It's not like zigzagging, so I'm not terrified of it, but it's probably going to take a minute cuz he is new this year. So, we'll see. Line checkin for 8:37. So, we've got Swirling Saucers at 5 minutes. Star Tours again 5 minutes. Got Mickey and Minnie Runway Railway is 10. Smugglers Run is 10. Aerosmith, Rocket Roller Buster 10. Mania is 10. Tower Terror is 15. Meeting Mickey and Minnie is 25 minutes, which is honestly not bad at all. Rise is 25 minutes, which is almost a walk on you guys. But again, that queue is really long. Slinky is 30, which is insane. The worst line is to meet Stitch at Celebrity Spotlight, and that is hanging out at 55 minutes, and it has been for a while. We really want to do that one, but I'm honestly a little nervous. The tactical bing bong smoothies have been working. Great way keeping them entertained while we wait on the Rex. [Music] I'm going next. Let's go. T-Rex. She's all struck. Wow. Party Rex is a party Rex. Party Rex. [Applause] Don't scare Rex. A big one. Thank you. by [Applause] great party. Little update for the Party Source Rex meet and greet. So, he is right here just before you enter Toy Story Land. And we got in line right past those two trash cans there, just a couple families down. and we were through the line in 20 minutes. So much faster than expected. They said it was going to be anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour. That was not the case. Also, heads up, he does not signatures. They just do photos. So, that's it. Photo pass is there though, so you can get photos. If you do have photo pass, they'll take photos with your phone, your camera, whatever. But he doesn't sign any autographs. So, just giving that heads up. We were hoping he would sign our board, but he is not signing autographs. At least not yet. Not this year. So, we'll see. Maybe that's something they add in the future. Maybe he can stamp like Buzz does. But for now, it was so cool getting to meet Party Star Shrek. We love that short. So, it was really fun getting to meet him. We enjoy the after hours event here during the normal part of the year, but I think the Dollywood nights are honestly better. While you don't get the free ice cream and popcorn like you do with the after hours event, you do get shorter wait times. And that's the thing that we're taking advantage of tonight is while some of the character meet and greet lines can be a little bit longer like Stitch. I heard someone say that just a few minutes before when they got out of when they joined the party or Rex line that they had met Santa Duffy right before that and that wait was an hour long. So some of them really popular ones are a longer line, but some of the wait times for attractions. Like we're walking up Slinky Dog, it's 20 minutes. And so we are taking advantage of the fact that a lot of the people are here doing more of the adult entertainment kind of things. And especially with kiddos, this is fantastic. If you have kids that can handle late nights or you can rest and they can keep going, then this is a great way to take advantage of that because it's honestly I think it's even better than the after hours party. [Music] Charlie. Yeah, baby. I might be a classic, but I still got a spring in my step. We're just fastest girlfriend. You ready? Woohoo. [Music] Yeah, [Applause] yeah. [Applause] [Music] Go go go go go. Can we stay in here and do it again? I wish, baby. Not too shabby to be on and off of Slinky Dog Dash in less than 25 minutes. That's That's good. But hopefully we're going to go over our game plan now. It's a little after 9, almost 9:30. So, we're going to hopefully do Mania, go watch the um Jingle Bell Jingle Bout at 10:00. And then hopefully meet Santa Stitch. He's the last thing on our priority list for tonight. And then after that, we're just kind of freeing to see what's left, how we're feeling, and if we want to keep going. The Star Wars rides have been so short. Like the weights have been so short. If our girls loved them, we would be going and doing those, but they're just like not the biggest fans of Star Wars. So, yeah, that's kind of where we're at. But lines have been a lot better. And also, I love the fact that they're not doing this kind of crazy thing like they have in the past where characters were alternating. Like last year, we had an issue where we got in line, we were told, \"This is the line for Bo Peep.\" Come to find out, they all of a sudden said, \"Oh, Bo Peep's got to take a quick break. Let's park the stroller.\" Um, she's got to take a quick break, but she'll be right back. She goes, \"Gone, gone, gone.\" Next thing you know, Lo comes out and everybody in line had been promised Boe. So they would do that a lot where they would alternate the characters and so you didn't really know who you were getting in line for the last few years and I love that they've improved that and so it's awesome to see Disney listening to feedback from guest. So if you have thoughts tell them. It doesn't mean that everything is going to just immediately change cuz it does it takes a lot to put on these events and to get them just right for the thousands of people that come to them. But that is very exciting to see that those changes have been implemented. And so it's nice to get in line for a character and know that okay, I'm going to meet the character that's expected. If things happen, they happen. But I don't know. The whole switching off was a little strange. I'm like, they do this all the time on Cruise Line and they do it flawlessly. We We can make this happen. So, I'm glad they did. But we're going to go ride a Mania. It says 30 minutes. I'm hoping that's not accurate, but we'll see. No, baby. There's no lightning lanes right now. There's no people walking here. No, no people yet. We'll see. Well, that's definitely going to be longer than 30 minutes to the point that they're at. Yep. We're going to go back out. B Peep is meeting. So, we're going to meet the B Peep and then we're going to go watch um I keep wanting to say Prep and Landing, but it's part of Prep and Landing. It's the elves from them, but it's uh Jingle Bell, Jingle Bam. I don't know why that's so hard to remember. 9:30 and our ride update. Smugglers Run 5 minutes. 5 10 minutes. 10 minutes for Rock and Roller Coaster. Rise is 15. Tower of Terror is 15. Nikki and Minnie are 20. Runaway Railways 20. 25 for Slinky Dong. 25 for Mania, which I do not think is the case. That was way longer. And then Stitch is back up to 45 minutes. I'm hoping it drops a little bit. We'll see. I feel that. Thank you. She's doing good. We're hitting that part of the evening where we have our tactical jammies. So, the only year that we failed at this and we had a huge meltdown at the end of the night was last year at our Jollywood night. I think it was Jollywood or maybe it was a Christmas party. One of them I forgot our jammies, our tactical jammies. And when we got back, changing from our dress to our jammies was just too much to handle. So, I still apologize to those that were in French Quarter Resort last year cuz it was it was not not a fun time for anyone involved. Um, so yeah, there's that. But we did bring our tactical jammies and I do have some wipes. I have these extra large water wipes. So, we can basically do like a wipe shower here in the bathroom. Are you impressed? I'm glad I'm impressing somebody. We have our jammies. And yes, of course, they are Christmas Toy Story jammies. Are you so excited? Yeah. They've been asking for these. I'm like, when you get tired, you can let me know. You can hold them. um let me know when you get tired and we can put on your jammies. And so we're getting close to that 10:00 time frame. So I think we're just going to go ahead and shift into those and that way whenever we're ready to head back, we're ready. Makes transitioning a lot easier. Yeah. If you take nothing else away from this video, pack your jammies and maybe some extra large wipes. Here's the Okay, my turn to You want to do it? There's a little pants on. Mom, can you hold it? Yeah. [Music] And here's more sets of pants. Yeah. Now we'll do back the shirts. Are you showing it all off? This little shirt. This is the back of it. A little front. Yeah. I like it. Your arm's in the way. They can't see. There you go. See hammer upside down. Turn. Are you so excited about your jammy jams? Yeah, I love it. Yeah, you love it. Woo! All right, let's go change. Yay! It's the most wonderful stor. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Where are you? [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] S is not in his office. Ah, great garland. [Music] Orlando. Oh boy. You all right there, buddy? I love you. He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his [Applause] [Music] But then I might just do a special match to make it spider You [Applause] [Music] just finished up with Jingle Bell, Jingle Bam. and we watched over in front of the tree there in the kind of Echo and Lake area. Now we're boogieing over to meet Santa Stitch. He is in where Olaf actually usually meets that he is not here for a party and Santa Stitch is. So we're hoping, fingers crossed that we can get in and out without a super long wait cuz we've been really lucky all night and not waited over 20 minutes for anything. So I'm hoping our lucky streak continues. [Music] She's out. [Music] Got to use that sling. Best $30 you can spend. Yeah. Absolute best. Soaking this up. You better. She doesn't do that. [Music] Blue [Music] girls are passing out. [Applause] We're here partying. We're partying till at least. [Applause] Oh, I got a picture. Yeah. And it's ready to go. the bottle. All right, got the blue signature. We're working on it slowly but surely. So, it is 10:46. The girls are both toast, so they're in the stroller. Hopefully, they're happily toast and not like upset toast, but we're still feeling good. Yeah, we're going to keep going. We're here to party. We got Blue Signature really quick and then Tower of Terror and Rock and Roller Coaster are short weights. So, I think Dean's going to go ride those. And I just saw a gingerbread bag. A gingerbread Minnie Mouse bag in. So, I may go to the gift shops while he goes to the ride. [Music] [Applause] Whatever he's That's where we're going. I am taking a pit stop though to grab a Gertie cookie because if I don't I have a little Bella who is going to be so sad tomorrow when she wakes up and she's like I forgot my Gertie cookie. So trying for a mom win here you guys. [Music] birdies have been acquired. Oo. Hey birdie, are you in line for power line? M sure am. I figured, you know what? Capital eyes. Working on the signatures. The line is not bad. Just five people. So short and we get to hang out with Gertie. Did you sign our beautiful family board? [Music] [Applause] [Music] They're so cute. Those are so cute. Yeah. Got the Olly ears. Yeah. And the Olly mug with the spoon and a spot for your cookie. Got a spot for the cookie right in the front. That's cute. We got Olly lounge bars. I want one of those, too. They are smaller. They're more like a cross bodyish. That's an Olly shirt. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Come on. I want that little stick. Can I get it? You think that should be your ornament? [Music] Because of the face, but he was Yeah. Heat. [Music] As we cross into the twilight Yeah, boy. [Applause] On the dark side of Hollywood, make sure you know just what kind of vacancy you're feeling. The longest thing about the Tower of Terror is the ride itself. There was no wait. There's no There's just no wait. That's awesome. We go ride it again if we wanted. That was great. [Music] Here [Music] [Applause] we go. 10 minutes. Let's do this. turns upside down. Bye, guys. that we're doing. Thumbs up and smile. I got you. Dude drives like my brother-in-law. Thank you. It pains me to say this, but I think I'm getting old enough to feel these rides now. I'm like, \"Oh, I don't think I can ride that three times in a row.\" Two times I think I could do that. Third time would wreck me. Honestly, the second time might wreck me, so I'm going to skip it. But that was good. [Music] I want to wish you a merry Christmas. I want to wish you a merry Christmas. I want to wish you a merry Christmas. I want to wish you a [Music] just under an hour left for the Jollywood Nights party. So I wanted to kind of do another round. 5 minutes. 5 minutes. 10 for a runaway railway. Smuggler Run's 10. Rock and roller coaster rise is 10. Toy Story Mania is 10. Hollywood Tower of Terror is 13, which means that's a walk-on. 20 minutes for Slinky Dog, 25 for Red Carpet, and Stitch is the worst contender at 50 minutes. But everything else has been fantastic tonight. Honest to goodness, this has been so worth the spend for the amount of stuff that you have access to. The shows that we've seen, the shows that we've had access to, the rides we've been able to ride easily, being able to do RERS switch, even if the kids are resting, is fantastic. So, and this is a soldout night. This isn't even a non-soldout night. So, I feel like that's really great. Usually these first parties can be a lot. They can be plagued with problems and issues. And tonight, if there were, we've not seen it on stage. Let's just put it that way. So, this has been absolutely amazing. The wait times for characters are significantly lower this year versus in previous 2 years. So, I feel like Disney's finally getting their footing with this party. And I would ultimately after tonight, I'm like, I will definitely buy tickets to this again next year because we've been able to do a lot of stuff. We've enjoyed the night. It's been great. We've been able to have some of the party exclusive things and also squeeze in some of those non-exclusive things. And we have almost an hour left to go. So, I feel like we could still do quite a bit. We'll see what we do. We're on our other potty break, so we're kind of trading off and doing that. Dean in less than 30 minutes hit both Tower of Terror and he was able to hit Rock and Roller Coaster. So that was fantastic. And he even watched a little bit of the tiptop suaree while he was there. So I feel like that went pretty well. But we'll see. Lucy's like she's getting a second wind. Are you getting a second wind? Always get a second. Yep. We got a stitch. Mommy was a sucker. Yep. And Bella got Can I hold the camera? Yeah, you can hold the camera. I can show. All right, you can show Bella is asleep. She has her little mini stuffy. Yeah, she's also spiky. Bye. the gingerbread. Well, with that update, I think we're going to head down this little area, maybe sneak in a little photo session, and then we'll see if we want to ride anything else. Like, we could literally go ride the two Star Wars rides right now if we wanted to with the low weight times that we just looked at. So, I I genuinely think this party is worth the money because there's Yeah, there's so much going on that it's not just here for lowweight rides. You're also getting all the party stuff. So, like you can kind of pick and choose which one fits your style and your family the best. So, even though this is really marketed towards an adult only, hands down, I we will continue to come and continue to bring our kids cuz I think it's great. Also, this is a sold out Jollywood. So, these times and everything shouldn't get worse through time because this is a soldout day. So, this is as bad as it gets. And it's been great. It's been fantastic. I this, like I said, this has been the best year they've had so far. I finally feel like they're getting their footing. Oh, yeah. So, I'm excited. I think it was good. Yeah. This is a good one. Ollie ornament. Is that Olly the gingerbread man? Can I see it? [Applause] What does it say? Special ornament. What does that say? Says Olly and it says Jollywood Nights. Now we have our ornament. was $26.99. Put it in the bag. We'll put it back in the bag for safekeeping. Okay. I don't want to be holding. I want to be on the ground and do this. I'm doing it. I'm doing the ollie. Awesome. Two, three. Bigger, bigger. One, two, three. One more. One, two, three. Perfect. Thank you. Scrub stitch. So, she's sleeping. You think we should leave right now? You're all done. Well, we grabbed our Jollywood photo with the sign and it is 11:57 and I think we are going to call it. We are not usually ones to leave early, but we have done a lot. The kids are sleepy and it feels like a successful night. So, that's going to be it for us. You guys have to let us know if you have been to Jollywood Nights. If you have, what is your favorite thing or favorite part of the event and put that down in the comment section? Would love to hear from you guys what you think of the party, but it's a hit for us. We love Hollywood Studios Christmas vibes. Anyway, and then all of the events and all the stuff and how smoothly tonight went was even better in my book. So, hope you guys enjoyed the video though and coming along. If you did, don't forget, click the thumbs up button, red subscribe button if you are new. We'll see you right back here in the next one. Bye guys. [Applause] Thank you so much. Thank you. Yay. It's a photo ornament. I love that. That's so cute. Slide the photo in the back. Oh, that is adorable. I love this. Okay, this in the first year are the best gifts. Like last year it was like champagne flavored marshmallows or something, but this is awesome. Like we will use this. We even use our coasters. They're on our nightstands. That's true. So, it's like an actual thing you can use. So, I'm so excited about this. That's cool. That's great. This is a nice bag, too, to be honest. That's really fancy. Yeah. I think they've leveled out. This was This was better. Yeah."

      "transcript": "I I [Music] take me home today. Take me out. Take me back into the sweet sweet. Good morning everyone from Hollywood Studios. The first time on this trip. I can't believe we've got towards the end of the trip and this is the first time we're here. It's just the way things worked out and the way it all got planned. But we have a day here today with Multipass. So we did pre-book three of our attractions. Alien Swirling Sauces, Toy Story Mania, and Slinky Dog Dash we were able to get. So all of the Toy Story rides. It is done on a tier system. So because we had Slinky Dog Dash, we couldn't have Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway, but after we've ridden our first one, hopefully we'll be able to grab one for that as well. Cla has just gone for a wander here cuz I was just doing a couple of things. So we're going to go meet up with her and head straight to Alien Swell and Sources. That's our first one. Let me just turn the camera around though, so you can really take in these Hollywood Studios vibes. I absolutely love the music as you walk into this park and just how it feels. [Music] Walking up through here really takes me back to the MGM Studios days cuz this part just does really feel the same. I absolutely love it. Let me know in the comments, did any of you visit this park when it was MGM Studios? This was actually one of the first parks I came to. Yeah, I did Magic Kingdom, then I did this one. So, I hadn't even done Epcot or Animal Kingdom when I had been to this one for the first time. So, let me know if you ever did MGM Studios. I can see Cla coming. She's obviously been in some of the shops. Right, let's head to Toy Story Land. And we would also like to do Walt Disney Presents One Man's Dream today. Yes, I do want to do that. It was closed. No, it wasn't closed last time, but there was a different show at the end, wasn't there, or something? previewing inside out too maybe. Oh, that's right. And as much as I do love Mickey and Runaway Railway, which I do. I think it's great. I really miss the Great Movie Ride and looking at this archway as well. I do miss the old MGM Studios archway, but I did hear, unless I've totally invented this, I think they might be doing something to this archway. It may even be going Oh, yes, I did hear that. Now, I will fact check myself and let you know if I've got that wrong, but I'm sure I very recently heard that that archway will be going. It looks like one man's dream is showing. So that's perfect. We'll do that later. He's waving at you. Hello. Good morning. Let's just see what the current wait times are looking like. So Galaxy's Edge, you've got 30 minutes for Smugglers Run and Rise of the Resistance is 80. Don't forget there is a single rider for that now, though. So if you don't mind that, you can do it a little bit sort of quicker. Becky did say they've done it a couple of times in single rider, and it still took quite a while, though. Alien Swirling Sources is 15. Slinky Dog Dash is 50. Thank goodness we've got a return time. And yeah, that's temporarily closed still. Yeah, Mickey and Minnie is temporarily closed. Fantasmic is at 8:30 p.m. tonight and there's only one showing and Toy Story Mania is 35 minutes. That is my favorite thing in the whole park is Toy Story Mania. I love it. It's just my favorite thing. I think it is the best thing in Hollywood Studios. I mean, Rise of the Resistance is obviously incredible, but for me personally, I just love Toy Story Mania. Yeah, I agree. Round Up Rodeo is just up here on the right. It's a restaurant which is um all you care to enjoy, they call it at Disney, not all you can eat. And um it's just so good. The food is amazing. I'll link a vlog below where we've eaten there. It is delicious. It's not a character experience, but there is some interactivity that goes on. I'll say that. Hang on. Jessie is here for you. Here we go. Alien swirling sauces first. And this ride is surprisingly fun. It looks very much like a children's ride, but it is actually very swirly. So, it's quite good fun. [Music] It's really bumpy. We're over at Woody's Lunchbox just grabbing a drink and I might actually get something to eat as well. I don't want to cause too much excitement here, but I am sat on the cheese chair. I mean, how long has Woody's Lunchbox been here? Like 10 years or something? I am finally on the cheese chair. Had to move location to the other cheese chair cuz this one's right in the sun and it's super hot. CLA just sat in it for a minute and she is boiling now. Um, so I'm just going to show you what I got. And actually, because the exchange rate is not too bad at the moment, I feel like the prices of stuff is really quite good. So, I paid £9.90 cuz I've just checked in my banking app and I got my coffee and I did buy a little carton of milk cuz I need proper milk. I just cannot with the little creamer thingies. So, I got those two. Then I got the kids little breakfast thing, which is tots with scrambled egg and gravy over the top. And you do actually get another thing of tots. You could have had two of these cuz you get two sides, but I just got one of those. Then I got a mandarin and an orange juice cuz that came with this and it was £9.90. And the size of this, you could get an adult one, which is much, much bigger, but this will be plenty for me, especially with these extra ones, too. M. Is it good? Do you want to try some? Yeah. Go on then. Yeah, that's tasty. The um M. Yeah, the gravy on top is actually really nice. Yeah. Thumbs up to this breakfast. Definitely. There go the soldiers. All done at Woody's lunchbox. And I'm so happy I sat on the cheese chair. What a highlight. That is incredible. But speaking of highlights, we're about to go on Slinky Dog Dash, which I love. It's such a good ride and always like really difficult to queue up in. So handy that we've got Lightning Lane actually, isn't it? Oh yeah, definitely. Current queue is 50 minutes standby. Glad to bypass that. A lot of this queue is outside as well, so it can get hot. Good job. [Music] [Music] I feel a little bit smaller than I am. Bigger and stronger, too, maybe. Love that. It's so good, isn't it? It is. It's a really good one. But I was just saying to Victoria, it's like it's quite a smooth um roller coaster. I mean, you do kind of like a little bit. So, it's not like completely smooth, but compared to something like Space Mountain and Everest, like they're way more jolty, whereas that one is, I think, easier for a lot more people to do. Yeah, I mean, that's the reason I actually don't do Space Mountain and Everest very often cuz it just I feel so shaken around. But that one is just really fun. It's really, really good. Okay, right into Toy Story Mania. We are rolling through these attractions this morning with Multipass. I will put on the screen how much we paid for it. I can't remember what it was today, but it's working out really good so far. We've already booked our next one for Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway, and we're about to book another one for Cla for Rock and Roller Coaster. So, it's working out really good so far. I always get the same like 29% and 28% accuracy. Look at this Jesse Spirit jersey. That's really neat. I love that. It's a shame that that doesn't pull. Yeah. Oh, that's cool, actually. Yeah, that's quite nice. Yeah. Let's see what his is on the other side. That's cool. These are so funny. I know. Have you ever put them on? No. Shall I? Does it feel like you've just got like a teddy bear sitting on your head? No, it just feels like ears. Normal ears. Yeah, that is actually quite funny. And the Lotso bag. This is so cute. I saw this on Shop Disney UK or Disney Store UK. It's now. It smells, does it? Yes. Oh, it does. Oh, I love that. And this is the B Peep one. You don't see this one as many places as the Woody and the Buzz bags. I do like that one as well, but the I would definitely get the Lo if I was going to. I love that. People who have never seen Toy Story would probably find it quite weird when people come and look at Lo merch. They'd be like, \"Uh, what are you doing?\" It does smell good. I love Lo. Cla's in the market for a snack, so she's just taking a look here. I did quite like the sweet cream cheese pretzel that we had that time in Tomorrowland. Yeah, that's nice. And they do have one of those here. They have nachos with cheese. Oh, they've got churros and the Jack Jack's Num Nom Cookie, which is $659. I'm just sat here now in the Pixar kind of courtyard section. I'm not quite sure what this is called. And Cla's gone off to Trolley Car Cafe. She decided she wanted her pumpkin drink that she likes. I have got the Round them up frozen cappuccino or latte. I'm not quite sure which. Um, but basically it's like a frozen coffee drink and it's got cream on top, animal crackers and M&M's and stuff. I just thought that was cute. And the peach mango thing that Cla and I love. That does seem to be an Epcot exclusive cuz they don't have that here cuz that's what we were going to get. We've got a bit obsessed with those. But let's try this. It's got quite a strong coffee taste. So, if you don't like coffee, you will not like this. But it is quite sweet as well. So, if you don't like any type of sweet coffee drinks, then avoid. That is good though. I love a nice beverage. Little sit down bit of people watching. might put you guys on the bench next to me so you can people watch as I do sometimes. [Music] Now it's time for Mickey Minnie's Runaway Railway. Love this. Like I said, I do miss the Great Movie Ride though. I can't help it. This is very good, too, though. It's always worth just looking at the floor as you're walking in here as well because they do have lots of celebrities. Got Jim Henson there. And then right in the middle, of course. Gosh, this is swell. And you've got Mickey Mouse, his hand and feet, and Minnie, Roger Rabbit. Then you got Steve Martin over there, who was a cast member at Disneyland before he was a famous actor. [Music] Welcome, folks. We're ready for a relaxing ride around the park. [Applause] [Music] 1 2 3 1 2 3 Oh, excellent. Let's [Music] Hey picnicers, told you nothing was going to go wrong. Love Mickey and Minis. And now it's time for one man's dream. And I would definitely try and do this. It's really interesting. There's lots about Walt and his family and his history. And then the show at the end is really good. So I try and make time for this if you can. And if you're here during a hot time of year, which let's face it, is pretty much all of the year in Florida. This is a really nice break from the heat as well indoors in the air conditioning. There's Walt and Mickey when Disneyland first opened. And I am going to answer some of your questions later on. Cla might go to Animal Kingdom. I'm going to go across to one of the resorts on the boat, maybe Swan Dolphin, and then maybe Boardwalk and answer some questions. And some of the questions are more geared for both of us. And we're going to do those in a couple of days time when we're on our way home, probably on the last day. But I will do some of them this afternoon cuz it'd be nice to have a break. And you guys have asked loads of questions, so I will be doing that in a bit. One of the things I love most about coming in here, I have got some footage from a solo trip that I did in 2009. It was filmed on a camera that I had like a mini camcorder thing that had tape in it. It wasn't even a memory card. And this part I filmed kind of all of this walking through and just the music. It really really just kind of brings back that memory for me and that footage which is my earliest kind of vlog footage that I've got. And they've got a mockup of the archway here. When you go into the Magic Kingdom, you will have seen that quote at the top here. You leave today and enter the world of yesterday, tomorrow, and fantasy. And this is a model of the Disneyland castle, which is a lot smaller than the one here at Disney World. It really is surprising when you see it in person. It's just so much smaller, but it just has such a charm all of its own. Even though it is smaller, I love it. And in here, you can meet Ariel, and it's the live action Ariel between 9:00 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. You can do that. All done in there. It was so good. What did you think? That was your first time seeing it. Yeah, I really liked it. It's It is like a little bit Well, if you if you love Disney and you love Walt Disney, then it can make you a little bit sad cuz you I've cried in there multiple times. Yeah. You just Yeah. I just really wish you were still here to see like what he's created. I I did also think um cuz on Disney Plus there is a a little series, Imagineering Story I think it's called, and it's got quite a lot about Walt and his like previous life. So, I and I have watched that whole series. I knew it, but there were definitely different [Music] himself like hoping that everybody remembers it was all started by Mickey and the fact that Mickey really saved the day like they were out of money and then he came up with the concept of Mickey and he completely still today is iconic. He totally is. Yeah, I love it. I love it. It's Disney. Yeah. That was amazing. So, we're going to now go down towards Rock and Roller Coaster, I think, cuz Cla's got a return time for that. I'm not doing it cuz it's too scary. And then we're probably going to try and do the Villains show, I think, as well. And I'm going to show you guys some of the merchandise. Goof's on a bit of a wander. And this is the area that's going to be refurbished soon. And I believe there will be characters maybe still back here. But I think you're going to be able to actually do some animating. You know, like the thing in Animal Kingdom where you can go to Rafiki's Planet Watch. I understand that there might be something like that going on back here is Star Wars Launch. At the moment, it looks very um Disney Junior. Yes. Yeah. And back here where Star Wars Launch Bay is, I think that might be where you're going to be able to go in and do some things like that. If I'm understanding it correctly. Cool. So, that'll be good. We're just walking past the Little Mermaid show and there's one right now. So, we're going to jump in on this. Cla's got time for her rock and roller coaster. We do want to try and do both of the shows today. We only just made that shutting it off. Oh my gosh, they literally closed the gate behind us. Wow, that was timing. I remember when this was the original Little Mermaid show. I remember seeing this and it's been closed for years now. So, I'm very excited to see this updated one and they said you can record but no external video lighting and no like flash. So, I will be able to show you a little bit of it. I'm mostly going to watch it because I have never seen it before, but I will show you a few snippets. Oh, this looks nice. I like the stage. Daddy, I'm 16 years old. I'm not a child. Don't you take that tone of voice with me, young lady. As long as you live under my ocean, you'll obey my rules. But if you were just listening, never to hear of you going to the surface again. Is that clear? is always green. Now somebody else [Music] [Music] [Music] now. Now, Angel Fish, you're here because you want to be with the humans. Find a Koreans to fall in love. Oh my gosh, that was so good. That was so much better than I was expecting and that I remembered from before. Like the combination of live actors, the puppets, and the projections. I didn't have any idea. And I was like, how on earth that that looks like Ariel's real, but like but I didn't. And then she was Yeah. Yeah. Cuz at first it was all animation kind of stuff. And then when you see Ariel, you're like, \"Oh, she looks real.\" And then you're like, \"Oh, she is real.\" It was it was just so good. It was amazing. I loved loved that. Was like exceeded expectations. It was just like a shortened version of the film and it was so good. And then at the end when King Ton basically said, \"I'm sorry you had to lose your voice for me to hear you.\" I then was like crying. So good. I just absolutely loved that. And it was really busy as well. The whole thing like you did have to actually move all the way down because there was everybody was like taking up all the seats. Yeah, it was brilliant. Loved it. But highly recommend that. Definitely. It's so good. And we do want to try and do the villains one as well. Yeah, I'm really looking forward to that now even more. And the other thing that was really neat, I do sometimes get asked whether I think it's worth it to have a Magic Band Plus over just the regular ones. And it was really cool because when the lightning and everything was going on on the stage show, my Magic Band was like flashing and buzzing and stuff and it did that during the fireworks show, so Happily Ever After and Luminous in Epcot. So, it is actually quite cool having the Magic Band Plus and it reacting randomly when you least expect it. [Applause] [Music] Drink is definitely in order. I think I might have a refresher. I love those. I think the strawberry one today. Oh, it's pretty quiet in here, too. That's nice. There's a lot of people waiting for their drinks, but no queue really. Okay, let's do some browsing. Straight away, here is a sweatshirt. I've never seen before. This Walt Disney World sequin one. Really like that actually. I love the color. That one is $69.99. They also have it in pink. I really love that. And in this cream color with the gold writing. This might be a new contender for which sweatshirt I should buy. Mickey and Pal social club. If you're a tennis fan, that would be a really nice top. Oh, look at this shirt with the Haunted Mansion characters. That's actually really cool. I love that. And there's a villain's shirt here with the green collar. This pink sweatshirt is really nice as well. I've seen so many different ones that I like. That one's $69.99, so pretty much the same as all of the others that I've seen. I feel like the cream version of that sweatshirt with gold writing and these fluffy ears would be such a nice combo for my November trip. There should just be enough time to get into the next showing of villains and barely ever After. I've been really looking forward to this. Yeah, I like what it's called. Yeah. Ooh, we've got a good seat. We have got a good seat. This looks very cool. I don't know if I'll be able to record, so you may see some snippets. If not, we will let you know as soon as we're out. Look at the like cracked mirrors and stuff. They look They look good, don't they? They do. They look kind of spooky. I'm excited for this. [Music] All for the days when only one fell inside me. A queen with a question. [Music] Yeah. A true one. Now sing. Go [Music] [Applause] perfect the light. It's never wrong to make things. That was so good. I loved it. Yeah, it was really good. You get made part of it as well, kind of, don't you? Like you get to join in. Yeah, you kind of There's a bit of audience participation, but not in a scary way. I know some people don't like that. Not individually. You as an audience have to you all like interact and or or not. Yes. Yeah. It's really good. And both of those shows actually exceeded expectations. I think it's really good to have new stuff that's actually really great. I loved both of those. I think the screens now, the technology they have with live Amazing. Yeah. With actual actors and all the stuff on the screens, it's so good. I think I'm going to walk out now and go and do some of your questions. So, I'm going to go to a resort and do that. I think Cla might be going to Animal Kingdom. Yeah, I think I am. I think I am cuz we didn't do everything before. I think I'd like to try and do Na'vi River. Nice. Um and just have a little wander around Asia. Yeah. Just kind of take it in. I might do the safari again. Yeah. Um I'm going to do that because we've got a long day tomorrow. We've got Beacon Barrel, we've got Tron, we've got the Cake Bake Restaurant tomorrow. I've also got a live stream for my Patreon members again. So, there's a lot going on tomorrow. So, I'm just going to take it a bit easier this afternoon and evening. But, it's been so nice today. We've done loads. I feel like it's so hot. Oh, it is so hot as well. Yeah. Compared to what it has been the rest of the time. So, this is a good time for a break. So, I'm just walking out here from Hollywood Studios now. And I was deciding which resort to go to. I was thinking, what do I want to eat as well? Cuz I'm going to go to a resort to answer your questions. And I was like, where could I go? What do I want? And I've had an idea. I'm going to go across to the Polynesian Resort. hopefully go into Tamboo Lounge and get the pot stickers and noodles because you don't have to have a Noana reservation. You can order those just at the bar. So, I'm going to go there, have that, and then I'll probably go across to Wilderness Lodge to actually sit and answer the questions cuz it's a bit quieter over there. Okay, bus stop number six. That's one of the good things about going to a deluxe resort. You always get to go to the closer bus stop. And just look at this weather today. It's so nice. It's beautiful. Oh, Polynesian. That's me. Am I going to get it? I can't run and I've got no one to run for me. I think the driver saw my attempt at a run and waited for me. They're so nice. I've arrived at the Polynesia and I can already smell what I think is Ohana. Smells amazing. I'm really hoping I'll be able to get a table in Tamboo Lounge and I've just noticed I've got a bite on my leg. When I was in Hollywood Studios, I was talking to Paul on FaceTime and I suddenly was like, \"Ah, something's biting me.\" I could actually feel it and I have got a bite on my leg. I'd avoided it the whole time so far. It's itchy. The one day I forgot to put insect repellent on and look what happens. So clearly it does work. I love this resort so much. Whenever anyone asks me which is my favorite, it's so difficult to say cuz they're all amazing. It definitely smells the best. I can smell it already. Oh my gosh, it's so good. I love it. And here is Tamboo Lounge. You just get in this line and hopefully I'll be able to get a table. I am seated over here in the corner which is a really nice little table. And just to show you the items that you can get foodwise, you can get a California roll. The honey coriander chicken wings are the same as the ones from Ohana. Barbecue pork ribs. Then you've got the pot stickers which again are the same from Ohana, the noodles and the shrimp. They have a lemonade with pineapple and passion fruit. That sounds so nice. I have just ordered the kiki lemonade, the pot stickers, and the noodles. This is one of my favorite things to do if I don't have a reservation or any plans for where I'm going to eat is to come here and have this cuz I love the food at Ohana. But the two things that I do love the most are the noodles and pot stickers. And this way I can do it a lot cheaper and without having to have a reservation. So I'm really happy that I got a seat here. You do have to wait a bit. I think I waited around 20 minutes. And I would have sat at the bar. That's actually the quickest thing is the seating is open at the bar so you can just go and sit if there's a space. But I really struggle to sit on high up chairs. Any type of like high top chairs are difficult for me. So I needed to have a normal seat and a normal table. This is my view. And I will always be happy with this. It's just one of my absolute favorite places to be. My drink has arrived. How beautiful is this? Wow, this looks so good. Wow, that is so nice. It's really pineappley. My food has arrived and it smells amazing. This is the pot stickers. And you can see it's a pretty decent portion there, especially as it's just me eating this. You could definitely share this. And this is the portion of noodles. If you were to maybe get like the chicken wings as well, if there were two of you, you could definitely share, I would say, like the three items. This is honestly one of my favorite things to eat in all of Walt Disney World. I love Ohana so much. But sometimes it's really difficult to get a reservation. Sometimes you don't necessarily want to pay the price tag for ohana because it is expensive. I don't do it every single trip. And let's have first bite of the pot stickers. So good. Yeah, it's my favorite thing. Confirmed. I love those. And we did have them over at Kona Cafe once, Katherine and I, but they weren't the same. They didn't taste as good for a while. They did have them over in Magic Kingdom at Sunshine Tree Terrace. not for very long and they don't have them anymore unfortunately. I'm just getting ready to leave now and just got the check. I thought I'd let you know how much it is. So, my total was 35.45. So, a lot less than Ohana. And I still got to have a little taste of it. I was thinking maybe I would have the bread pudding, but I can't manage it. I'm too full. So, I'll have to get that next time. Just got off the boat at Wilderness Lodge and they've got these really nice chairs here. This would be really cool to sit here and just chill. Never realized that was there. But I wanted to come here to show you the progress on Lakeshore Lodge. This is a new resort that's being built. Let me see if I can zoom in. That's going to be a really nice location on the lake. Looking forward to visiting there when it opens. I do absolutely love this resort. I know Cla will feel a bit sad that this is where I decided to come to because she loves it here. I know she had a good time at Animal Kingdom, though. I just heard from her, so I'm sure she'll tell you all about it when I get back. Here it is. Look at this. Really is stunning. I would love to stay here again. And I have a couple of times just for like one or two nights I think at the most. I would love to stay here for a week or something. That would be amazing. Here we are. Let's just give you a look over this balcony down into the lobby. Honestly, this hotel is so impressive. It's absolutely stunning. This morning, I asked for some questions on Instagram from you guys, and you definitely delivered. I've got loads of them. Some of you asked questions for Cla and for both of us. So, I'm going to save those for our very last day when we're traveling home and we're going to answer those together. One question I did have several times. How was Beacon Barrel? That's one that I can't answer yet cuz we're actually doing that tomorrow. So, when Cla and I answer the questions on the day that we're going home, we will answer that one and let you know how we got on. I'm really, really excited to do that. Mimi is asking, \"Where do you like to stay with your DVC points?\" There's so many DVC resorts that I love. Obviously, the Grand Fian is my home resort and I do love it there, but it does take quite a few points to stay there, so I don't often do that, but I do love it. I also love staying at the boardwalk. That's another of my favorites. In terms of ones that I stay at more often, I would have to say Animal Kingdom Lodge. And because Paul loved it so much at Kadani Village, I can see us staying there a lot in future. He absolutely loved it. And although I love Jambo House, I do find Kadani Village a bit quieter and a bit more relaxing because there's just less people there. So, we do really enjoy that. I can see a lot of Kadani Village in our future. Jessica is asking, \"How's the weather? Still very hot and humid. My next trip is 2 weeks from now.\" The weather has actually been a little bit different than what I'm used to in September. I do often come out here at this time of year, and normally it's very hot still in September. Actually, for the first week of the trip, it wasn't really that hot. So, it was very humid at the beginning. Kind of like a swimming pool changing rooms or you've had a really hot shower and had to walk back into the bathroom, but overcast. Does that make sense? It was like that a lot at the beginning and we had some rain. Then we actually had a couple of evenings where it was really quite cool. So, when we went to see the Starlight Parade in the Magic Kingdom and we were sat there, there was a really cool wind and it made it feel very, very much cooler than I'm used to. But today has been very hot again. So, this is more like what I'm used to for September and we've not had a lot of rain the last few days. So, yeah, it is quite hot still and you do get quite a bit of humidity. Victoria is asking, \"How do you deal with fatigue, especially the feet, you do need to take some breaks.\" I would say if you've got a 2 week holiday, I would definitely recommend taking a few days where you do more relaxed things. So, maybe go to the pool, maybe do a bit of resort hopping, but where you do take time to sit down and just relax a bit. If you are in the parks all day, every day from open till closed and you try and do that every single day on a two week trip, you will just be absolutely exhausted. Um, one thing that's really important is wear very comfortable shoes. And if you have bought new shoes for the trip, make sure you wear them quite a lot before you come out here. I don't just mean like potter around the house in them. Wear them and go on some longer walks and make sure that they're comfortable. You're not going to get blisters and things like that. I mean things like that can happen even if you have warmed them in but make sure you bring blister plasters with you and if you do feel like something like that's happening just try and take some rest. I would say just taking breaks and there's so many great places to take breaks. You don't have to feel like all you do is go back to your hotel and sit in the room. You can go to other resorts like I'm here right now at Wilderness Lodge. Most of the resorts have got lounges. So this trip we've been to Victoria Falls at Animal Kingdom Lodge. That's a beautiful one to go and look around. We went to Coronado Springs and went to Three Bridges. There's so many resorts and they all have big lobbies with big comfortable chairs. So, I would say take breaks. Just don't try and push yourself too much. It's very easily done, especially when you're very excited and you want to like do all these rides and do everything. But if you do that for too many days in a row at the beginning, it will spoil the rest of your trip because you will just be so exhausted. So, just try and take breaks is my biggest tip. Just a big Disney kid asked, \"What are your favorite value, moderate, and deluxe resorts?\" My favorite value resort is Pop Century. My favorite moderate is Coronado Springs, and my favorite deluxe, I would have to say Polynesian, but in the deluxe category, there's so many that I could say. I love them all. I haven't met a deluxe resort that I didn't like. Well, Gleon Dad is asking, \"Have the crowds been typical?\" I would say yes with the exception of Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party. So when we first got here, it was very, very quiet. And that is what I normally experience in September, at the beginning of September. Anyway, a few people who got here the week before we did, so right at the beginning of September, we got here on the 8th. Um, they said that the first week of September was so quiet. They were like just walking on to rides, really, really quiet in the parks. And I would say the first half of our nine days, the first four then I would probably say were very very quiet. Especially in the Magic Kingdom when there was a party, a Halloween party that evening, very very quiet for the attractions. Tiana's Bio Adventure, we saw it 10 minutes or 15 minutes quite frequently. So very quiet. And then the last few days, I would say, have been busier. So it is starting to pick back up again now. And Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party is actually the busiest I've ever seen it. And it was weird because last year was sold out the night that we did it and so was this year but this year was a lot busier. So I guess maybe they sold more tickets but yeah it was very very busy but otherwise I would say it is pretty typical. If you want very quiet usually the very beginning of September is the way to go. Joe is asking have you ever been in January? Will be going and I don't know what to expect with the weather. Yes, I actually went in January this year. So, it was right at the end of January, kind of into February and it was very, very cold this year. That's not necessarily typical. Um, I have been around that time of year before and it wasn't as cold. This year there was a bit of a like cold snap and it was colder than it was back at home. I remember walking into Epcot one morning and my face was just frozen. I was in like jackets, leggings, it was very cold. When you're going in January, I think you just need to pack for all different weather situations. So, definitely make sure you do pack stuff for if it's cold, but maybe have layered kind of things. So, have a lot of t-shirts in case it is a little bit warmer, but bring hoodies and things that you can put on over the top. I would bring a coat or a jacket because I definitely did need that in January this year. The one thing I will say is great about January though, you've got the Festival of the Arts in Epcot, which I absolutely love. And when it is colder, I just find that I can do much longer days because I find the heat is what really takes out of you. When it's very, very hot, it makes you more tired and exhausted. When it's cold, I feel like I can just totally do all day in the parks and it doesn't make me feel as exhausted. So, that is a massive plus to coming in January. D West is asking, \"Best quick service meal in Animal Kingdom.\" In terms of quick service, I've got two answers. One is what I believe to be the best and the second is what is my favorite cuz those are two different things. I think the best is Satuli Canteen. It's not actually my type of food. I do love the cheeseburger pods, but the bowls that they do where you can have like noodles or rice, I think sweet potato, and then you have chicken and beef and stuff. I think it's a really, really good meal because it's very different to other quick service. It looks very good. All of my friends rave about it. It's just not my particular type of food, but I would say that is probably generally acknowledged to be the best. I think I'd probably have to say Yakin Yeti quick service, but I also love Flame Tree Barbecue. It's kind of a toss up between the two. I like Yaketti for breakfast quick service and probably Flame Tree Barbecue are like better for lunch. Kim is asking, \"What was your favorite new snack you have tried this trip?\" It is the churros at Nomad Lounge. Nomad Lounge churros are absolutely incredible. Go there and have coffee and churros. Honestly, you won't regret it. That definitely is my favorite snack that I've had. Jenna is asking, \"How does ordering items to your hotel work? I.e. Amazon, takeouts, etc., do you wait in the lobby?\" Yes. So, if ever I order anything from Uber Eats and that can include items because over here in the States, you can get stuff from Target or um Lowe's and Best Buy and all places like that, they will deliver through Uber Eats. So, I ordered a fan last year. I ordered my memory card, which I picked up yesterday. So, if it's anything like Uber Eatats where you literally order it and it comes kind of there and then you can do that at your own hotel or a different hotel that you're visiting, you just obviously have to sit and wait for it to get there. And I always just put in the instructions meet outside lobby and then they just come and you pick it up. If it's Amazon, then you would get that delivered to your own resort. Just bear in mind that there will be a package handling fee, which I think is $6 if you get anything like a package delivered, something that you're not picking up yourself at the lobby. If you do order anything, I've had Eron Condrin packages delivered before, just make sure within the address that you put hold for guests arriving and then the date that you're arriving. That's quite important if you're ordering something ahead of time. This is a really nice question. Main Street Calling said, \"What does a Disney holiday mean to you?\" The short version would be happiness. A Disney holiday means happiness to me. It absolutely is my happy place. I know that's like a cliche thing that people say and you get it on t-shirts saying this is my happy place, but it really truly is for me. I've been coming here for 23 years. This is my 37th trip that I'm on currently and I just absolutely love it. Since I was 19, I started coming and it is literally kind of been with me then through all of these years. Everything that has gone on in my life. All of my friends have got really into it. fact that all of them love coming to Disney and some of them have bought DVC. They're out here like Kate and Becky have been out here while we were. My mom has now been on trips with me. Paul absolutely loves it as well. It is just so special to me and it just feels like my second home. It really does. I love it so much. Being here is just total happiness and peace to me. So, that's a really nice question, I think, to end this vlog on and we're going to answer the rest of those questions. Like I said, there's plenty more. Some of them were for Cla or for both of us and we will answer those in our next Q&A session. Thank you guys so much for letting me have all these questions on Instagram. You always deliver with loads of questions whenever I ask and I love answering them. A huge thank you to everybody who has come up to say hi on this trip. We have met so many of you. I feel like this trip is probably the most people that I have ever talked to and I love it. Please don't ever hesitate to come over. I know some of you sometimes worry that you're um disturbing what I'm doing. Please don't ever worry about that. I love chatting to you, finding out what you've been doing on your trip, putting a face to names that I see in the comments section. I really do love it. And just a huge thank you to all of you for watching these vlogs. Everything you guys do, I really do appreciate each and every one of you so much. And I know all of you guys just love Disney as well. Whether you've been on a trip or you are hoping to do one at some point, some of you, I know, don't even plan on doing a Disney trip, but you just love watching the vlogs and I just love making these vlogs for you. So, a huge thank you to all of you and thanks for taking the time out of your day to watch this one. If you did enjoy it, please do give it a thumbs up. That helps other people to find it. I hope you're all having a great day and I will see you in the next one. Bye. [Music] [Music]"

      "transcript": "Hey fam, and welcome to Countdown to Vacation Christmas edition. Today we are counting down to our Disney World Christmas trip and we are going in and packing both makeup. So, I'm going to do a little bit of a get ready with me so you can kind of see what my Disney makeup looks like this time of year as well as we're going through my toiletry bag for the whole fam. Also, ways that I never forget a thing and three things I also never pack for Disney. Before we jump too far into the video though, I did want to quickly introduce myself. Hi, my name is Ashley and welcome to my channel, Pixie Dusted Mom. Here I share all kinds of tips and tricks and hacks for all things family travel to Disney World. So whether it be packing, prepping for your trip, or planning your park days, we are sharing all the things from top to bottom as well as vlogs from our adventures along the way to help you get excited for your next magical adventure. So, if that is something you're interested in, you've got a trip coming up and you want all the trip countdown stuff, go ahead and click the red subscribe button below the video. Or if you're part of the fam that's watching on a TV, mom, look, I made it to the big screen. But there is a QR code here on the screen. You can pull out your handydandy phone that is probably also in your hand as well. If you're watching on a TV, open the camera app, point it towards that, and be able to go over and subscribe and join our little internet fam here. would absolutely love to have you. And now with no further ado, let's go ahead and talk about all of the things that we're packing. I am no makeup artist and I'm definitely not a makeup YouTuber, but I do have my makeup setup here from what I wear to Disney, especially this time of year. It varies a little bit when it's in the summertime and we're like really melting, but it's like less melty this time of year. So, you can get away with a little bit of a different makeup. And then I also have my little handy dandy mirror. So, if I'm looking down and I'm not looking at you, I apologize. I'm not trying to be rude. I just I don't have this fancy setup where I can like look in the mirror and this whole situation. So, we're gonna work with what we've got. But, let me lay my makeup out here on the bed really quick and then we'll start chatting and getting ready. While I'm doing this, I'm curious. Does anyone else lay out your makeup in order of how you put it on your face? Or is that just me? Because I feel like especially on those early Disney mornings where I am tired or even early mornings at home as a mom and you're like half asleep and you're like, I need to get ready. I need to like look somewhat presentable here. Then I just find this really helpful. I don't know, maybe that's my type A showing a little bit too much, but that's that's just how I like it. Now, for me lately, my go-to, and usually my home makeup is my Disney makeup, and my Disney makeup is my home makeup. Spoiler alert. So, there's not a lot of difference, but for me, I've been loving the Esteee Lauder Double Wear. This is It's kind of I go back and forth with like I buy it and I'll use it for a while and then I'll take a break and be like, I don't want anything that much coverage. And then I get something thinner and I'm like, I want coverage. And so, I go back to it. Um, a lot of times during Prime days and things you can find it on sale, which is usually when I stock up personally cuz I don't want to pay full price for this stuff. But that is one of the foundations. So, I usually carry two different options. So, this is my like I actually want a face of makeup cuz I just I enjoy makeup. So, I want to put on some makeup. If you don't like makeup, that's okay. You don't have to wear it. If you just want to put on an SPF lip balm and some sunscreen on your face and go, girl, you rock it. I personally enjoy makeup, so that's why I put it on. That's just I do it for me. I don't do it for you. I don't do it for the views. I don't do it for the camera. I do it because I like it. It makes me feel good. But now that we're getting all that rabbit trail out of the way, the other one I use is the Dime Wondercreen. It is a great tinted moisturizer. It does have SPF 30 in it. During the summer months, a lot of times this is what I'll wear. I won't even pack this. Um I will just go in with the wonderscreen and wear that with a little bit of bronzer. It just feels a little more relaxing and lighter on the skin. This time of year, I just gravitate towards the thicker makeup. I don't know. It just it's how I'm I do. But we're going in my beauty blender and literally usually almost a pump will do my entire face. So, that is what I'm going to do. I have my little handy dandy mirror here. I don't really need the light, but it does have light on it, which is cool. So, it's got a a cool light, a sort more so warm light, and then also a bit of a mix of light, which I have a lot of light coming through this window. How many times can I say light? But it would help if I turned the sponge towards my face. Okay. Um, but going to go in put this on just a little bit. I don't really put it on super thick, just enough to even out my skin. When it has a tan, my skin looks better. When it doesn't, I am not the biggest fan of my skin, and I haven't been since I was a teenager. So, there's the backstory nobody asked for. Right. I will say if I do have a little extra redness, I will go in with a small like drop of the foundation and just add and kind of build the coverage up there just a little bit for me personally and my skin and how it is. And then I also make sure to drag it down my neck so you don't have that like whole makeup line cuz it's not fun when you forget it and it's like um and my neck always I don't know what it is. It doesn't tan. It just my chest will tan, but this is just Yeah, it just doesn't tan. I don't I don't know. And I'll even like do the whole like lay back thing so your neck is exposed. It just It doesn't do it. Sunlight and it just don't get along. Okay. Next up, I go in with the Do It All Concealer. So, I will pop this on. You just twist it and it comes out the top like so. And then I will I'm just going to look in the viewfinder for a second for this one. I will pop it in there. And then if I have any bumps or extra blemishes like I do today, they're like, \"Oh, hey. How's it going?\" You've not had some of us in a while. So, let's take you back to middle school. It's great. Side note, am I the only one that thought when you got older and like you became an adult you wouldn't have to deal with acne or bumps or zits or whatever you want to call them. Like I was fully intended. I was like, \"All right, I just got to make it to adulthood and I'm going to be fine. It's it's all going to be good. Like I can survive this. My skin will even out. It will be perfect and I won't have to worry about getting bumps anymore because I'll be an adult and I won't be a hormonal teenager. Well, apparently I'm either not an adult yet because I'm 33. I thought 33 was an adult, feels like an adult. I have to pay bills like I'm an adult. I have to do all the other adult things that we have to do as adults, but somehow this just hasn't caught up to that. Um, okay. But that looks better. No more red bumps. So, we got rid of that. Next, I like to go in with this jumbo crayon and it is in the shade coconut. It is from NYX. It is a multi-use face stick. So, this one is kind of a highlighter. So, I will literally go in and just color in my entire eyelid from lash line to brows with this. It is sparkly, which I love. And especially with the holidays and stuff, I feel like it works even more. I feel like it works in the summer cuz you want that glowy look. And then in the winter, you want that sparkly holiday look. And so that is what I'm doing with this one. Next, I'll go in with the NYX butter bronzer. This is in the shade all buttered up, BMB02. It's the number. You need a number. But we're going looking at this like it's a compact. I'm going to go in and do a little bit of contourishing. I say contourish cuz it's not really full on contouring. I don't know how to do all that properly. But I do my makeup and I like it. So that's okay. But I'm going in and what's left on the brush after I do the main section that I go in for. I'll like go back and like just add a little bit other places to just add a little glow there. And that sun-kissed look next. Oh, I'm going to take this. I forgot skipping a step. I've got my little brush here. It's just a random makeup brush I have. I probably should get an eye shadow brush, but I'm going to just run this in the crease to just add a little definition there. So, you can see I have that on that eye, but I don't on this eye. When I'm not talking, I'm a lot faster at this. I can usually have this done in 5 to seven minutes, depending on how many times my kids say, \"Hey, mom.\" So, we're we're we got it down to science. Next, go in with the brow glue from NYX. This, for one, holds your brows in shape, but also adds a little bit of color. I have pretty thick brows, so I don't need a ton of like filler cuz I feel like I skirt on the edge of Princess Mia from Princess Diaries eyebrows sometimes. So, yeah, kind of identified with that one. Um, but this is great. Holds them into place. So, we've got that action going on. And then this is a new mascara for me that I've been using in the last couple weeks. And guys, it is so stinking good. My internet sister Caroline over on Instagram sent me this and she was like, \"Hey, I know you like your lashes. Can I send you some mascara and you can try it out?\" And here you go. And I was so excited to try it out, but I was not expecting all this. So, it's got one end. It's kind of a creamy color end of the stick, but it is like a primer prepper kind of part of it. It really separates your lashes with the brush that it has. And just this alone is wild and makes my lashes look so much thicker. I'm like, \"Holy cow.\" And then I'm going to do the whole eye and then I'll do the whole other eye so you can see the difference. But go in with the like full on mascara and it has this like rounded brush on it. And sorry, I'm like not trying to not put the mirror in my face so you can see what I'm doing. But I go in with that mascara and it just builds it up even more so. And it is awesome. I love that mascara. I don't know if you can see it as well. I'm telling you, I'm not a beauty influencer, but you guys asked for makeup, so I'm like, we're going to talk about makeup. as I put this down as if I don't have to do my other eye. So, hold on. Talk amongst yourselves while I do the other eye. So, the more I stare in this mirror, the more like, \"Okay, yep. I need to go make a brow appointment cuz these these puppies need to be done or else we're going to be right back to Princess Mia.\" And that's not a cute look. Halloween's over. Okay, now that that's done and I'm not about to walk out of the house with one eye with mascara on it. Um, next up I'm going to do this blush. It is Milani Cheek Kiss in the shade Luminoso one. It's shade 110. So, you just squeeze it out and like sponge it on or you can kind of rub it. But I'm just like down just a little bit here. And then for this one, I literally just use got a little bit more on this side than this side. Hold on. We can fix that. But I just kind of blend it out and it gives this nice glow. So it's almost like a highlighter and blush kind of in one cuz it's just got this really nice glow to it which I love. Okay, got the glow going. And then last but not least, before we do lips, I'm going to go in with this E.L.F. setting spray. This is a new one for me. I've recently started using this in the last like week or so, and I'm really liking it so far. I saw it on Emily Rose Instagram account. She had done a get ready with me a few weeks back, and I was like, this looks so cute. But I'm going to go ahead and spray some of this on to just kind of hold the look all together. And I love that it is a very fine mist. Like it is not something that is super thick and when you spray it on it's like you're getting spit at. Like I don't know if you've ever used some like that. I've had some setting spray. I'm like, \"This works okay.\" But then I have these like little drops of it all on my face and then the the makeup can kind of look weird in those areas where it's like splotchy and I'm like m I don't know. But this is a dewy setting spray and a shockingly fine mist and literally they hit the nail on the head with the hash or the tag for it there. So, um yeah, thank you to Emily for recommending that cuz I'm like this looks so cool. And then with the holidays I'm going to be taking two lip colors. I talked about this in my outfit video, but one is the NYX Fat Oil in Newsfeed, and then the other one is the CoverGirl Outlast Ulti Matte, and it is matte, and it lasts 24 hours, but it is in the shade wine o'clock. And you wouldn't think that this is going to be super red, but like this is the shade. Mhm. That's red. But it is the perfect holiday red and it stays. and is not going anywhere. All right. My only note for this is be careful putting anything on top of it like a topper basically of a gloss or anything like that because it can mess with the um lasting effect and the hold of it and it can kind of like run in places and yeah it just it makes it smear off a little bit easier, that sort of thing. So if you want the ultra lasting just kind of leave it and don't put anything on top of it. Um, but if I am going for more of a like lightweight look, then I'll go for this and I'll re reapply it. But with this lip, I can put it on say for the entire holiday party, Jollywood, Christmas party, and it's on all night through all the cookies, all the cocoa, all the um eating and snacks and treats and all the things that we do, it will stay on. So, this one I'm having to like kind of reapply after every time I do something to get the lipstick off and it kind of fades. But this one holds its own. So good. So, wanted to kind of go through that. Next up, I'm going to talk about toiletries. Now, like I mentioned, there are three things that I do not pack toiletry- wise for Disney. One is body wash, the other is shampoo, and the third is conditioner. The only caveat to that is I have straight hair, and it really likes the conditioner that Disney has. My daughter has my husband's curly hair. they don't get along well at all. And so, while it works great for my texture, she is the caveat that has made me start packing conditioner again. So, anything that is deep conditioning, I will go ahead and make sure to pack that for her. But as far as the other items, I don't do that. And then another thing, a fourth thing that if we are staying at a moderate or a deluxe resort is I don't usually pack lotion. So, unless I'm wanting like a specific scent or one of my lotions that I'm loving at home, I will use the body lotion that is provided in the room for Disney. So, they have these little blue tubes. Smells like sea salt. It's great. It smells just like the body wash and the shampoo and conditioner that you're already getting ready with. And it also like I don't know, something about using the Disney toiletries has this Disney bubble effect. I don't know. It's just nice. It's like you're laying down in your bed in your resort, you're there, you smell like sea salt, and it's just like it's a vibe. But if you don't want to vibe, then those are some things that you can take. But for me, those are things that I don't have to worry about packing cuz I'm like, I know I like those. I enjoy those. They work. It's fine. Um, but going to go ahead jump into the toiletries and exactly how I pack and how I don't forget things. There are three things that I do to help eliminate forgetting toiletries cuz I feel like that is the number one most forgotten item is your hairbrush or your toothbrush or something super duper simple. So, here are the three things. So, for one, I use a packing list. Obviously, that is very helpful. Something about checking it off. Just I don't know, it's so satisfying and also is like I know that it's in there. Number two is to lay everything out in order of how you use it. So, give me a second and I'll talk about that and I'll show you what I mean. And then number three is to use travel size products or containers that are travel size containers that can be refilled with your normal everyday products. This eliminates that last minute, last second scramble packing because you can go ahead and have all these things up. Your toiletry bag isn't having to stay laid open because you've got to add your toothbrush. We use travel toothbrushes. And spoiler alert, after we're done, we throw it away cuz I don't want to bring this nasty thing home with me. And then things that need to be refilled like lotion or face wash. Those just get refilled each time. And you're not worried about, okay, after I take my last shower, then I can pack. You're going ahead and getting all this stuff done in advance, which makes it so much easier. So, starting out, the vessel in which these things are packed in. I love this. It is two different sides. It has multiple zippers here. So, you've got the zipper section in here, zipper section in here. And I love how wide it opens. So, you are easily accessing everything in this. As well as the fact that it's clear helps you be able to find exactly what you're looking for. So, this one is fantastic. It is great. You can use this um for either checked luggage or I've used it for carry-on. It's clear. Each side is a quartish. And honestly, in all of our years of flying 10 plus years now, we've never had a question about it not being in a quart-siz bag. I know some people have different experiences, but that's been ours. So, this is the situation. But to show you what I mean by packing in order. So, say this is my skincare routine. So, in the evening, I'm going to use my makeup remover wipes, take my makeup off. I'm going to then use my little cotton pad or not cotton pads, but they're like they're little gauze pads to then take my eye makeup off. After I do that, and my makeup is kind of pre-off, I'm going to go in with my face wash. After I wash my face, I'm going to put my night cream on. After I put my night cream on, I'm going to put on my serum. After I do that, I'm going to put on my lash serum. And then after I do that, the final step is a little bit of a thicker lip balm to moisturize my lips overnight. So, you see what I mean? I'm literally going through my routine. Like, literally, this is what I do every night when I get ready to take my makeup off. That is the order in which I go in. Now, when I'm at home, I actually have a gel that I use instead of these, but I don't want to take that gel. So, for now, we're using this. But you get the idea. That is how we're stepping through it. So, once I get out of the shower, I have lotion. I just refill this after each trip or as I'm preparing for the next trip, I'll refill it. This is regular lotion. This is green lotion. This is after sun lotion. So, if you have a sunburn, this is the best stuff ever. Got those two. And then deodorant. So, it's lotion and then deodorant. That's all I do after my shower. I don't I don't know if there's more you're supposed to do, but that's all I do. I'm keeping it basic here. When it comes to hair care, we're going in. I have a little popup brush, which makes packing a lot smoother. you're not having this big giant hairbrush in there. And I also do a comb cuz I have little girls that I have to style their hair. We have water spray, dry shampoo, some styling taming curl cream, hairspray, and then a thing of hair ties, both elastics, regular hair ties. I have pony pricks in here. So, if you do have those clear ones, you can use these. Really easy to get out. Just be careful and only get the hook of the clear elastic. And don't cut your kid's hair. Um, so don't do that. So, just be gentle. And then I also have my spray here. This is a blingy TJ Maxx find, but this is for my body spray that I put in there. So, this is for me. This is not not necessarily for the kids. Well, if it'll open, but you just twist it up and it has the little spray that it comes out. And I have a little bit of glitter for the girlies so they can have some pixie dust. But you kind of get the idea. And then when it comes to little tools, I do carry our tweezers. I have two sets of tweezers. One that stays at home, one that goes with us. I have an extra pair of nail clippers. These are just from the dollar store. Like they're not anything expensive, but they get the job done when we need something. And then also my little travel scissors. So, these are great. I've been able to take these through um even in my personal item bag, carry-on bag. No issues going through TSA with those. And then same thing, we've got our little thing. thing. I don't want to push one out too far, but little floss strips or like handheld flossers in here. Got toothbrushes for hubby and I, toothbrushes for the kids, toothpaste for us. I do need to get a kids travel toothpaste. That is the one thing I am out of right now. And then our Listerine. And so I just kind of have those things like grouped together and in order. So you kind of get the idea. But these are the toiletries. I get questions of what toiletries do you take? Nothing super groundbreaking I don't feel like. But I do feel like packing and kind of setting these things up in order and also using these sizes like we are three days out as I am filming and getting this ready and it makes it super easy to where I'm not having to leave this laying open like I said to add anything extra. It's going to be done. I'm going to put this in and it's going to be all zipped up and great. And then for those that are curious, this is how it all looks within the bag. So, I have all of our toothbrushing stuff, our post shower stuff, and my skincare routine is all in this side. So, kind of showery get ready for bed in the morning kind of things, getting ready things is in here. And then the other side is full of our hair stuff. The only product in this that's not travel size is this. So, this is a kids cream. I actually picked this one up at TJ Maxx cuz they needed another one. I saw this one. I'm like, let's give it a shot. We'll see how it goes. Um, so I grabbed that one. So that would be the only thing is I would need to either decant that or find a travel size version of a kids gel that I could use for styling their hair. But everything else, if I wanted to pack this in my carry-on personal item, I totally could. But due to that guy, this has got to go in the check bag. But everything fits in here great. I'm not having to sit on the bag to get it to zip up. And then you just zip them together like so. super easy and genuinely makes this so much better. And now my toiletries are packed and I'm ready to go get on an airplane, you guys. That is going to do it though for today's video. Thank you guys so much for hanging out with me, putting on your makeup with me, drinking your coffee. Hey, just cleaning your house, whatever you are doing. Appreciate you being here and also being part of my end of the video club. Thank you so so much. I really appreciate it. If you've made it this far into the video and you aren't already subscribed, would love it if you'd click the red subscribe button below and end of the video club. You're going to have to leave me some makeup emojis or travel bags. That way I know you're part of the secret end of the video club. But thank you guys for being here. Appreciate you so incredibly much and I can't wait to see you in the next part of this countdown to vacation series."

      "transcript": "Hello you guys. Today we are doing a Bag Smart luggage review. I'm so excited. We are getting to unbox their new getaway suitcase as well as their new blast backpack. I have been a huge fan of Bags Smart for quite a while now. Own multiple of their products, use them really regularly in my pack with me videos and you may actually own quite a few of their products too. With being a leading travel brand available on Amazon, they are a huge seller go-to. So, wanted to share that because you've probably seen their personal item bag, their charging case, their packing cubes, this tote bag that I love to carry the stuff around for the kids when we're at home, and my new favorite from them, their rolling personal item, which fits within budget airline sizes. Absolutely obsessed with their products. So, when they reached out to collaborate on this, it was an immediate yes. We're gonna get started with the suitcase because this one is the one I am most excited about. We're getting ready for another trip here soon. And so I'm like, I want to get it out so I can maybe pack with it and take it on our trip, test it out, give you guys a full experience and review. So, let's get this thing out of the box. Oh, this is fun. Try that in. This is their new 24 in size out of their Getaway collection. They've got everything from a 20-in to a 26 in. But what really drew me to this was how this suitcase actually opens. So, let me open it up and let's talk about it. For one, it does have a builtin lock, so you don't have to worry about getting your own. Yeah, you just saw that the zipper went up. The way this opens was so intriguing to me because it's not your standard zip around the middle suitcase. This part is actually going to be your expander section. So, you can unzip that and it will expand and give you just a bit more room within the bag. But, I thought this was so stinking cool. So, with this, you can actually pack in layers and also a little bit deeper. So, if you have larger pieces, you're not worried about having to put things in the middle. You do have this optional piece here that can kind of act as a separator between layers if you want to. And then you also have your classic straps that are there to lock everything in place. You can tighten those easily. Even with one hand, I'm able to tighten those. And the buckles are really easy to open and also close together. This is cool. I felt like this was really interesting to be able to get into a suitcase like this and have that depth feature. On the other side, you do have multiple mesh pockets here, so you can put different things and have loads of organization, but then you also have these kind of wet pockets here. So, if you needed to pack some toiletry pieces into here, you can. And it also has little straps in there as well to hold those bottles or anything like that into place so you can put your smaller travel size toiletries in there. And it is locked and loaded and ready to go. Here in the middle have another one of those wet pockets and it again has the bottle holders in it as well. So it kind of keeps those things again in place, keeps it from sliding around and that is fantastic. And then here in the very tip top, you have this section that you can unzip all the way and peel back and have a little section of a little stowaway organization in there. That'd be great for packing socks, underwear, undergarments, things like that that you may not want in your main bit of your suitcase. And ultimately, if you wanted to get away with using this suitcase and not utilizing packing cubes, you probably could. Especially if you're living out of it, you're just getting things out of the suitcase and zipping it right back up. You're not someone who wants to unpack. This is really cool cuz you could organize things across the top kind of fold it file folder style and then be able to pull out as you need it. So, this is really cool. And I'm very excited to pack this and use it on our next trip cuz this is cool. And it also has the little like hinge buckles to keep the suitcase top from like falling all the way back like so. So, when you open it again, just kind of Yeah. sits right there. If you want it to open all the way though, you can unclasp these and it is now free to fall all the way back. Obviously, it's running into my dresser there, but I'm genuinely impressed with this and cannot wait to pack this suitcase cuz I am a packing gear nerd. And this looks really fun. And for those of you that are more of a carry-on style family, the 20-in of this looks fantastic. So, I will link it down below as well so that you can go over and check that model out cuz it looks so cool. I mean, if we were more of a carry-on family, that would have been the one I would have picked. But we're more of kind of a checked bag, walk through the airport, a little more effortlessish family. So, this was the one I grabbed. For those of you that are packing cube people, though, I'm a big packing cube person myself, so I'm right there with you. The new Blast packing cubes are actually new compression packing cubes. They come in this kind of beige color. The suitcase that I have came in the color shadow, which is kind of a dark charcoalish gray color. And then they also have a beautiful steel blue. So, they've got a few different options for this collection, but let's unbox these and see what they're looking like. So, it comes in this multiack of six. So, it does have this little drawstring bag, which is great if you need a little kind of throwandgo bag while you're on your trip. This is awesome. It is kind of mesh down at the bottom. So, this is great for a pool bag, beach bag, anything like that. If you are not wanting to take something large and you just need to put a few things in it, this would be great for that. They have two of the packing cubes in the smaller size. These are compressed down, but you can open them up, expand them, fill them full, and then zip them down. They have a large size that comes with one of those. It does have a nice little buckle here, so you can hang that up if you needed to. And then they also have two of these mediumsized packing cubes as well, like the bunch came in to begin with. So, you've got multiples. These are great for packing pajamas, uh, undergarments, all that good stuff, and being able to cinch it down and kind of compress as much as possible out of it and pack a little bit more and fit more in your suitcase. Especially if you're traveling for a long extended period of time, something like this can be super useful. And then the last piece we're going to unbox, I'm just going to be perfectly honest, my husband's probably going to steal this and use it instead of me because when we were looking at the pieces like, \"Ooh, I like that backpack. That looks really cool. Can I use the backpack? So, it has already been spoken for. So, I'll get the suitcase and he will get the backpack, but this one is their new 38 L blast backpack. It is within the size parameters for budget airlines, which makes it a two thumbs up for me. We are huge budget airline fans and love to do that. So, anything that can fit within that size is amazing. This is a great backpack and it does more than just be a backpack. So, this one you actually open it like a little duffel bag, which is really cool. And I find this super handy when you are trying to pack personal item only and need to get a lot into a bag. This is going to be amazing. It does inside have the clips to kind of restrain your items into place there. And it has one on both sides. So, you've got the nice little buckle there to kind of cinch everything down, which is fantastic for being space saving. I also love that on the top half of this backpack, it does have this wet bag. So, if you're needing to pack toiletries in here with you, you don't want to take an actual toiletry bag, that's going to take up even more space. This is amazing and gives you so much space- saving room inside of the bag. And then you can close it. And it does have a bit of compression due to the buckles that we unnapped in the beginning on the side. So if you are needing to kind of batten down the hatches and squeeze things in, this is awesome. Has a shoe compartment in the bottom. So if you are seriously packing personal item only, this is another gamechanging option to be able to throw your shoes. You could also use this as a dirty clothes section or anything that you might need here. And it does have ventilation. So those stinky shoes aren't just stinking up the backpack and everything else that's in it, which is great. You can zip that around. And then it does have a padded back, which is fantastic. It's got the buckles so it can stay securely on you. The straps themselves are also padded, which is wonderful. Love a good padded strap. And it has a trolley sleeve. So if you are pairing this with your getaway suitcase, this is great for being able to just set it down. You can give your shoulders a nice little break as you are strolling through the airport, which is fantastic. And it also has a little secret compartment back here. I think this is amazing when backpacks have this is you can put any valuable items back in this small secret pocket here in the back. And then let's see. We're just exploring this together. I'm so excited. I'm such a travel gear nerd, so I'm sorry. I'm kind of geeking out for a second. This zipper is one that will come around and actually expand. So, just like you have an expander on a suitcase, it does that to give you a bit more space inside of the backpack in itself. I kind of feel like an infomercial at the moment. But wait, that's not all. So, we have another set of zippers here. And they open up to the handy dandy tech compartment. This is great. And also, which is an amazing reason why having a padded back is fantastic because your laptop can go in here. The sleeves itself are also padded. And then it has a tablet pocket as well. That is again also padded. And this is a nice soft area. So, you've got a great spot if you are traveling for work and you are needing to carry your computer with you. This is awesome. I I think this is freaking amazing. And and then in the top lastly, I think it's like a Mary Poppins bag. I just keep finding more and more pockets on this thing. Hey, feed me your extra stuff. Like all of your random things. Your sunglasses can go in here. Any little chargers or your wallet or anything that you might need to get to. It's got a little mesh pocket here in the top that is a zipper pocket. This is cool. I don't know that I'm going to let him use this one. I might want to use this one. This is cool. I am excited to test this out. We've got front pockets. We've got a little side pocket here. This is This is cool. And I do like that you can hold on to it from the side as if it's a briefcase. You can wear it as a backpack. There's a lot of really good options out of this bag. And it opening up from the top kind of like a duffel bag or like a suitcase. Again, it is gamechanging for accessing things as you're packing in there and being able to get to more of it. Then it's not buried in the bottom of a backpack and you're filling it this way. You can actually lay it down and fill it almost as if a file folder, which means you can get to everything. You're not rummaging through and destroying the organization and the time that you put into folding your items and placing them in here. That is so helpful. So, this bag is probably going to end up in our heavy rotation cuz it's Yeah, that's that one's cool. As a quick example, we are going to use this as our arrival day bag on our next trip. And to just show the organization and the space that it has, I'm going to pack it up really quickly right here with you guys. So, we're going to fly to Disney World and we're going to be using this, like I mentioned, as our arrival day bag. And it's awesome because it also has this divider. You just stick the little pieces through the holes and it creates a shelf that you can organize things with. So I have my husband and I's swimsuit. So I have uh swim trunks, have his swim shirt, a cover up for me, and my swimuit top and bottom here. And so I'm going to put it on this top side of the shelf. I'm also going in with my girls swimsuits top and bottoms and then shorts to use as a little bit of a cover up. So, we're going to stack those in on top of that as well with this shelf organization. I also have room over here that I can put some grab-and-go toiletry items. I can put a hairbrush in here, any of our sunscreens, things like that that we will need there. If I want to put a couple of beach collapsible little beach toys or something, I could also do that inside of this bag. And then in the bottom section, I'm going to take this stack of clothes and fold them. This one needs to be refolded, but we're going to fold these up and just pop them in the bottom. So, the bulkiest thing here is going to be my cardigan for the evening is the bulkiest piece. So, I'm going to layer that to the bottom. Got a pair of shorts that are going to go in here. And then my husband's shirt that he's going to put on with his pants that he already had on earlier in the day. And then my girls dresses here as well. So, we're going to just pop those right in there in the bottom. And again, we still have room on this side for toiletries, anything else that we might need to add to this bag. I can go in with the buckles and be able to cinch anything down that we might need to for this as well. One on this side and a little buckle over here. Buckle these as well. Zip it down. And that helps to save some space in there. And then a couple things about the backpack that I completely missed being excited and overwhelmed by the amount of organization on this is that the zippers for the laptop compartment, tablet compartment can actually join together to be locked. So, we've got the two holes there. You line them up and then you're able to put your lock through the center of that little hole and secure your any valuables. If you've got your laptop, usually those are pretty expensive. Tablets are expensive. any other gear that you might need that is valuable, you can absolutely put it in that pocket and be able to kind of secure it a little bit better than just with a regular old zipper. But now that the backpack's ready, I did want to show it on the trolley feature. Slides on really easily so that you're not having to carry it around. Has the nice little strap going across here. So, if it tips, the backpack is not falling off, which is fantastic. Especially if you're doing this for a carry-on, having that little strap on the back, you think it's no big deal until you're walking through the airport and your shoulders aren't hurting. That is literally gamechanging. So, if you're looking for a travel backpack, this is a great one, and you're going to love that trolley sleeve. Seriously. And then lastly, to show one of the features of the suitcase. So, on the handle itself, it actually has a built-in scale. So, when you hit over 50 lb or 23 kg, it is going to turn red. Dean, would you demonstrate? You can see it is now red versus you can set it down. When he lets go, it is back clear again. But when you pick it up, you're using the scale and it turns red like so. How stinking cool is that? That it's already built in. Like we threw a 30 lb weight in here. We've got a five, two, three lb multiple like toiletry bags that have stuff in them. And that is really cool that you can just close it up, pick it up really quick. You're not having to look for your scale. That's really cool. That is really, really cool. A few days later, but we are getting ready for our Disney World Christmas trip. I am so excited. We are using this 24-in getaway suitcase from Bagsmart to pack for our vacation. And seriously, it's kind of blowing my mind with all of the organization and the way we can use this. I have all eight outfits for my family of four. Shirts, pants, the whole thing right here. The only thing that's not in here is socks, underwear, undergarments, that sort of thing is not in there. We don't have shoes. But eight outfits. I'm talking princess dresses, thick puffy dresses, and all made it into this suitcase. And I love that I can unbuckle this, fold it back, and just grab out the stack of outfits that I need. It almost eliminates as far as for clothing. And if you do the folding like flat method, the kind of like a Marie Condo kind of method of folding, you can actually get all this in here without the need for packing cubes. Those are going to be great for, like I said, undergarments, pajamas, swimwear, those sorts of things that you want to organize, but this is like a packing cube in and of itself, which is so exciting. And so, the fact that I was able to fold up so many outfits and get them in here is kind of insane. And I still have all of this space in the top that I can put pajamas and undergarments and swimwear and all that stuff. So, all of this extra space is awesome. So, seriously, this gets a five-star review out of me for being fantastic for family travel and the organization. You don't even need a luggage rack to set this thing up on. Like, you could just open it up and it's there easily accessible. You grab out the stack of outfits that you need for the day for your entire family and you are seriously ready to go. So, very, very excited about this. So, I will have the link to this as well as all of the other pieces that I've talked about in today's video down below in the description box. Don't forget through December 15th, you will get a free set of those packing cubes when you make your purchase. So, that is very exciting if you are wanting to grab some suitcases, grab some luggage, and get ready for an upcoming trip. That gives you even more bang for your buck getting in those free items. But, thank you again to Bags Smart for sponsoring today's video, and thank you guys for watching. and hanging out with me as we test out this new luggage. I'm genuinely excited. Like way, way too excited. This feels like a Mary Poppins bag. It's holding exceptionally more than I thought it would. But thank you guys for watching. I'll see you in the next one. Bye."

      "transcript": "I I take me home today. Take me out to play. Take me back into sweet sweet. Good morning everyone and welcome to a brand new Disney detail vlog. And you can see behind me where we are. Very exciting. This is my favorite park. And we were discussing our favorite parks the other day. Cla thinks it might also be her favorite park. First trip to Disney was back in 2018 and Epcot was my least favorite. I don't know if it's like because of the age of my children and like perhaps maybe they didn't enjoy it as much, but I don't know. We just didn't feel Epcot at all. Whereas I don't know. I feel like now I like the feeling of just coming here. It's kind of quite chill and relaxing and but then it's got guardians and I don't know I just I just like being here. I wonder whether it's pe the effect of people coming here with me because Claire now has totally changed her mind. Paul loved it and said it was his favorite. I think I just love it so much that I just I don't know radiate that. I absolutely love the other parks but um you know it's not as if I don't love the other ones. It's just special. I love it so much. So today we're going to be riding Guardians as soon as we get in. Actually we've got a lightning lane for that. Then we are going to be doing a couple of other things. I've got a live stream for my Patreon members at 3. We're also dining at San Andell Inn. I'd like to maybe do Living with the Land Again and perhaps Awesome Planet. They were really good. And Journey of Water, the Moana attractions. We're going to do some more of that. Yeah, hopefully. I think Saurin at the moment is about 45 minutes. That'll probably lower down a bit later. So, we'll see how we go. And we're going to watch Luminous tonight as well. Here we are. And we've got beautiful weather compared to last time. It was dark and gray the other day with rain. So, this is stunning. And I just love the music when you come into Epcot. Okay, we're just cutting through connections. Connections cafe. I always get creations and connections. I know you do. And now because you do, I now have no idea what is what. No connections. Connections cafe. We're just cutting through to go to Guardians. Keep everything crossed. The conga or just the Inferno. That's all we do. Just I just don't want Iran. No, we don't know it, so we don't love it. But anyway, it's always good. So, we're going to go and ride this. And then maybe I do need a drink cuz it's very hot today. It's super hot, isn't it? Compared to the rest of the Absolutely boiling. Yeah. But at least actually like Guardians like queuing is completely indoors. Yeah. So, like we'll get nice and cool in a minute and stay cool for a while. Yeah. And then we can grab a drink. I might actually grab a Joffrey today. And my outfit today, by the way, these ears are from Magic Maker ears. These lemon yellow ones. And I've got my other lemon dress on today. I do love a lemon outfit. I do. I don't know why. I couldn't tell you, but I do. Here we are. I love this ride. I do truly believe that this is the best thing they have at Disney now. I love Flight of Passage. I love Haunted Mansion. Those two are forever, you know, my fave. But I do think this is just incredible. Guess what song we got? We got Disco. So good. Cuz you can start dancing like immediately, can't you? You're still flying backwards and dancing. Yeah, disco inferno the best. We were so happy. It did the slow burn thing at the beginning though with which is like is the intensity building up cuz it says jump back and normally you go straight back but then it there's like some dialogue that happens and then you just sat there and you're like where is it going to go? It's so good. Amazing. Absolutely love this. I am so so pleased that we were doing it again and that we got that song. Me too. Definitely. Ah, they do have the mango peach refresher again. I really liked that the other day. So I might get one of those. It does have caffeine in it. She It doesn't taste like coffee in the slightest, but it does come from white coffee bean extract or something, she said. So, I think I'm gonna have that. We've got our drinks, and I feel like this might be one of my new favorite drinks. Peach and mango. Peach mango refresher. Yeah, it's really nice. It's got the tiniest bit of oat milk in it, which gives it the slightly cloudy look, but it does not taste like milk in any way whatsoever. It's just like watery juice. Yeah, it's really really nice. And of course, we did have to get the Joffre donut. It just looks too good really to not get, doesn't it? When you're stood there, you're like, \"Oh, I need one.\" Yeah. I mean, they're very sharable. So, I would do that. Mom will be jealous. She loved the Joffrey's donuts when we were here. It was one of her favorite things. Actually, we used to share one a lot of days. We're all done in Connections Cafe with our drink. And it's coming up time for the live stream now with Patreon. So, I will leave the vlog here just while I do that. And when I pick it back up, we'll probably be inside the land pavilion, I would think. And hopefully, we're going to ride Living with the Land or maybe Soarin and then head off around the World Showcase. It actually doesn't seem too busy here today. Becky said it was super busy yesterday to the point where they left early because there was such long lines for everything, all the food and wine festival booths and the attractions. It is hot today. This is probably the hottest day that we've had so far. But because it's a breeze, it's actually really nice compared to when I was here in May, which was just so warm. [Music] So, the live stream is all done. That was really nice to catch up with the guys on Patreon. If you're interested in that, I'll link it below. And I found Claire again. As you can see, she's been doing the Moana walk through. I went and saw Walt and had a little chat with him. Photo with him. Love that. And then I also watched the first song on Encanto. The encou did do quite a bit. That's good. So, we're going to ride Living with the Land now. Um, this was one of my mom's favorites when we came here. She loved this. And then I need to go on a quick mission um to buy a memory card. I don't know if I told that story. I can't remember. If I did, you already know. If it's a terrible story, it's not a good story. If I didn't, I'll tell you later. Um, and then we're going to reconvene by France in the World Showcase and make our way around the World Showcase and eventually end up in Mexico for our San Helen dinner. Yes. Yummy. And I love Mexico as well. Me too. My favorite one. We haven't been in that pavilion yet. No, I know. So, we'll do that. But first of all, living with that. If you're looking for a relaxing ride, this is always a good one. And actually, this ride is quite good seasonally. So, depending on the time of year, they do change around the displays that you're kind of seeing. Oh, do they in the green houses. So, like at Christmas. Yeah, at Christmas they actually have light up things going on if you do it at night time. The American prairie once appeared as desolate as the desert, but over time. Welcome to our living laboratory where scientists from Epcot and the US Department of Agriculture, cow, coffee, and rice are well known around the world. While there are more than 50,000 edible plant species in the world. All done on Living with the Land. I love that. It always makes me think of my mom. So, I love it. Change of plan. I do need to go on the mission to get the memory card, but I'm going to do it after dinner because we didn't realize what time it is. And it's almost time to go over to the Mexico pavilion. We're going to take a slow walk over and have our dinner. And I am actually ready for it. We've had half a donut today. We were just discussing. You're going to ask to sit by the river? I normally do. I normally ask for a water table. Perhaps we should and then we can let you know how long we have to wait. Oh yeah, let's do that. That would be a nice idea. Yeah, I usually do that and it's worth it cuz it's beautiful being there by the water as the Grand Fiesta tour boats go past and we will try and do Grand Fiesta tour afterwards as well. We're just passing by Bramblewood Bites where they have grilled cider brind pork tenderloin, cast iron seared river trout and cast iron roasted Brussels sprouts and root vegetables. Definitely the fish and the Brussels sprouts would not be my thing. This area does change what it's called with the seasons. It is currently harvest hollow. We've got mills and molds here. You look on these pillars, they tend to have photos, which is more what we want to see. They have butternut squash and ginger bisque. That could be nice, actually. Freshly baked carrot cake. Paul would love that. Full fruit cheesecake. Ooh, all of these sound good. And apple, cinnamon, and caramel mini churro sundae. That sounds pretty good. I would actually eat all of those things. Maybe if we can squeeze it in, we could try that afterwards if we haven't had a pudding. I don't normally have dessert at San Helen. So, I could totally missed the mon. Uh I think I caught it on camera just behind. Yeah, I I actually the full fruit cheesecake or the um churro thing. I would totally actually probably be quite nice. Do you know that almost reminds me a little bit of the um the cheesecake or whatever it was you had last year in Be Our Guest. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That does look a bit like that. Over here is Forest and Field. Here they've got an autumn chili, which is um a vegan item. Pumpkin mascapony ravioli. I would totally eat that. That sounds amazing. Sashiat. How do you pronounce that? I have no idea. I don't know. I'll let Cla take that one. And that one has ham, sundried peppers, arugula, full squash, and pistachio pesto on warm fork catcher. And here we are in my beloved World Showcase. Like I said, I feel like I could wander around here every day. I love it. Spaceship Perth is looking amazing. I do miss what this looks like though during flower and garden festival. Oh yeah. Okay. Cuz it's covered, isn't it? You've got all of the flower beds. Then you've got the floating flowers. It just looks stunning at that time of year. And it does feel busy here in the World Showcase, but not unmanageable. During food and wine festival, it is a Sunday as well. It is always going to be busy, especially when you get into like late afternoon, evening. I will say though, even though it's nice to be places in Disney World when it's not crowded, when we were walking around here the other day when it wasn't open yet and there was no one, I feel like there's no atmosphere. Yeah, maybe I actually kind of would prefer it to have a bitier. Yeah, just a bit busier. You don't want it crazy, but it's a bit more atmosphere when there's more people around. I'm not going to, but I could totally have another peach mango refresher. Let's hope it stays for you. Yeah, I hope it stays as a permanent thing. It's so good. Got the Mexico booth here. Let's see what they're doing for the festival. I reckon I I think these might be up my street, but let's have a look. Tostada de carnitas, which is braced pork on top of fried corn tortilla. Flout is fried tortillas filled with beef and salsa verde, romaine lettuce. That sounds nice, too. And then they have a flan or flan. Flan flan, which always makes me think of friends. Yeah, it does. Me, too. Yeah. Uh here we are back in my happy place. Well, all of Walt Disney World is my happy place, but especially the Mexico pavilion. It actually like does blow my mind because you can start feeling the coolness like way before you get there as well. Not that I can yet. No, but you do like you start feeling the coolness. It just like draws you in even more, doesn't it? We're going to tell you when we can feel it. It does drag you in. Let's see. I just I felt it. I'm getting it. I'm getting it. As we come in here, they've got a sugar skull wall. 64 sugar skulls on display were hand painted by Alberta Hernandez Santiago, a Mexican folk artist who created colorful wood carvings at Epcot's Mexico pavilion since 2002. That is the first year I came to Disney World. They are good. And there's a whole wall of them. The tequila bar is always extremely busy. It's very small, so you can't fit a lot of people in there, but yeah, everybody wants to go in. We've got some three Cavalero's ears there. I feel like they're slightly different than what I've seen before. We're all checked in, and they did say it'll only be a few minutes for us to have a water table, which is really great. Yucky. Yeah, we are. Normally, you have to wait a lot longer, so that's really good. And they have changed the seating in this restaurant recently, so I'll film as we're walking in. There's a lot more booth seating. They've almost put dividers up between some of the tables, which is different than it used to be. So, I'll show you that as we go by. You can kind of see it from here, actually. Can you see there the walls that are in between the tables? So, it's almost just a bit of a privacy screen, I guess, so that you don't feel too close to your neighbors, which is nice. We are seated. And this table is absolutely beautiful. You probably see behind me. We have the boats going by on Grand Fiesta Tour. And let me just spin this around. You can see the rest of the restaurant. So, this is the view of what I'm looking at. And it is just beautiful. I love it in here so much. I honestly when I'm thinking about reservations of where to eat in Epcot, this is always up there. Yeah, it really does feel like you're just transported. So, when you're outside walking around the World Showcase and it might be very hot and busy and just crazy. You come in here and you suddenly do feel like you're on a different vacation and it's very relaxing. It's cool and you Yeah. You feel like you're in a restaurant outside. It feels like it's the evening. Yeah. It feels like it's nighttime in Mexico in a beautiful restaurant. So, we love it. It can be a little hard to read the menu because it's kind of dark in here, but they've added these little lamps. They do a soup here, which I've had a lot of times before. The tortilla soup with fried corn, tortilla strips, avocado cheese. It is good. That is really good. Corn ribs. Oh, is that where they like cut chunks of corn on the cob? So, it almost looks like ribs. It's It's like a vegan kind of thing that you get a lot of places. I have had that a few places. I don't know. I think it's cilantro um spring onions. Cilantro is um what do we call it? It's the stuff that tastes like washing up liquid to me. The lemony stuff. What is that called? Coriander. Oh, that. Okay. An herb. Herb. It's an herb. I don't think they call spring onions spring onions, though. Scallions. That to me sounds like crabby. Oh, yeah. It sounds like fish to me. Yeah, that's so weird, isn't it? Be something that does sound like that. That is maybe something. I don't know. Yeah, I always think that it sound totally sounds like something fishy. The chips are here and I fear it is an even bigger portion than last night at Free Bridges. This is a huge amount of chips. If it is a busy day in Epcot, this will just chill you out. Yeah. Right. Definitely. Cuz you can hear the water as well, can't you? Food has arrived. And this is my soup, which they just pour into the bowl. already all sorts of stuff. Yeah. What was in it? Avocado, tortilla strips and stuff. And then they call the soup. Right. Okay. And these are the corn ribs, which is exactly what I thought it was going to be. They do look quite nice as well, actually. They like the cheese like all over the top. Yeah. And these are big as well. I've had these before, but they've been small. These are You can't really see mine. I don't know if you can see it on the camera. Claire has the blue arajas, and it's basically chicken with a cream sauce. I think was there plantains underneath was roasted potatoes, peppers, onion, and then a creamy sauce um with the like chicken, grilled chicken breast. I feel like these rib things are going to be very very very Let me add another very messy. So this is what they look like. Oh my goodness, this is so good. That's like the corn that I get from the Flower and Garden Festival. You know, the garlic, but instead of garlic, it's like a nice savory kind of sprinkle and cheese. Spice on it. A little bit. It's not spicy though. It's more um just flavorful than spicy. That is delicious. Let's just try this soup. All of it is amazing. The queso and the chips, this, the corn, this Claire's. The food here has actually got better over the years. back in like 2010, a lot of people didn't rate it around then. Um, that was the first time I came here, but it has just got better and better and better, and this is delicious. So, big thumbs up. Highly recommend this. The soup was messy. The corn was messy. I don't even know what's going on here, so excuse anything that might be on my face. Um, the dessert menu, I'm not having a dessert, but Claire is going to go for something. Just to let you know what they have, though. They have trilles, I think is how you say it, which is milk soaked sponge cake topped with sweet corn, ice cream, and toasted almonds. I have had the sweet corn ice cream here before. It really does taste like sweet corn. It sounds gross, but it's not. I don't know. It's hard to explain. Then you can just get the sweet corn ice cream on its own with popcorn and chili powder. Then they have a flan. And then they have Mexican flavored sorbet and a celebration cake. But that's $39, so it must be big. Here is Cla's flan. That looks nice, actually. Let's get the verdict. I never really eat desserts here. M. I'm assuming that's good. M. That is so really creamy. Yeah, good choice. Okay, it's raining, but it's really sunny. This kind of thing does happen in Orlando. It's actually quite nice. It's cooling things down a bit. I am just on my way to the beach club to try and sort out this memory card. The hard drive will not connect up to the laptop, so I can't put anything more on it, and I don't have enough storage on memory cards. So, I need to buy another one. I don't want to bother buying a whole new hard drive because that'll be expensive. And the only real way to get a memory card, not too expensive, is to order one using Uber. So, I'm going to order one from Target, but I need to get somewhere where I can get it delivered. So, I'm walking out to the beach club. Hopefully, I can then get it delivered and I will be sorted. So, these things happen. You get technical issues. I do have spare memory cards with me. One of them is broken, as in physically broken. I didn't realize it's like snapped and the other one just isn't working. So, I'm having a massive tech fail on this trip. I'm just walking past the Alps booth and I will be honest, that cheese is stinky. It's not just me. I saw several people just walking past there holding their nose and kind of going, \"What is that?\" It does really stink. I know some people love stinky cheese. I do not. I just like cheddar. I am not a stinky cheese fan. And I definitely want to come back to Germany later to go in the caramel store to get something. That's why I didn't have any dessert at dinner cuz I do prefer to grab something from there or a festival booth. You never know what I might see. [Music] I made it to the beach club. I'm in this nice comfy chair now just waiting for this memory card to turn up. I did get the boat over cuz there was one there just as I was walking out of Epcot. So I figured I've got some time to kill while I wait for it. So I just took a nice little boat ride over and hopefully it won't be too long. It says like 20 25 minutes. I've just got to wait for this memory card to come. It's so annoying when things like this happen. Um next time I think I just need to bring even more spare ones and maybe an extra hard drive. I've never really had that happen before. It was a brand new hard drive as well. So I just don't know why it's decided not to work. I've got it. expensive memory card compared to back home, but it was still cheaper than getting in an Uber and going to Target and back. So, at least I have it now, so we're all sorted. Let's go and find Cla. It's probably going to be quite busy here in the World Showcase. I absolutely love this time of night. It's not quite dark yet. Perfect weather, too. CLA did lots actually while I was my memory card. So, I went on the Grand Fiesta tour. What did I then do? I then wed I was pondering and ended up going back towards the land pavilion and I went in there and I did soaring and actually the thing that was quite cool cuz I was by myself obviously and they've got like questions like a trivia quiz thing on the wall so I was actually like entertained the whole way through. So that was quite good and so obviously is a great ride. And then I went up and watched Awesome Planet. Nice. Went through Canada and popped into the little shop there and then around UK and that was then when you messaged me. Yeah. And we met up to got some nice stuff done and we've got a really good spot here for the fireworks now. Oh yeah. We got another mango peach pressure. We're a bit obsessed and this is our spot for the fireworks. So we're right on the bridge and you can see the firework cruise boats. So you can book yourself a private fireworks cruise and then it comes under the bridge here and they all line up to watch Luminous from there. So they look quite funny there all lined up actually. I've normally seen one or two but I've never seen that many there. [Music] [Music] Welcome to the great gathering. [Music] Welcome my home. Welcome You will be a million hearts all the time. [Music] Heat. [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] Heat. [Music] So close. [Music] [Music] The Heat. [Music] [Applause] Heat. [Music] See [Music] the great symphony of us. Hey everyone. As you can see, I'm back home now and I needed to do an ending to this vlog because of the issue I was telling you about in this vlog with the memory card and the hard drive and all of that. The one clip which was the end to this vlog I ended up losing. So, I thought I would just quickly pop in to end this one. This was a quick visit to Epcot. So, it was a shorter vlog than normal because we were just doing like the afternoon and evening and then there were other things going on. So, this is a bit of a shorter, quicker vlog, but I hope you guys still enjoyed it. And I thought this would be a good opportunity to quickly tell you about our trip plans because things have changed for the upcoming Disney trip. As a lot of you will know, I've been trying to plan a trip back to Disneyland Paris for a really, really long time. For various different reasons, it hasn't happened. We were going to be going in the summer, just gone, but Paul and I moved in together at the very beginning of July, and then June kind of ended up being a lot of prep around that. So, we sort of missed that window. We will be going to Disneyland Paris more next year because there are a lot of new things coming up with the World of Frozen opening. I think things are opening up in the spring. I don't know an exact date just yet, but we will be doing more Disneyland Paris next year. But I really wanted Paul to do a trip just to see it as it is now. He's never been before, so he hasn't seen any of it. I got to thinking about doing a Christmas trip and I was kind of debating back and forth. We can only do one or the other because Paul only has so much annual leave from work. So, we had to decide, do we carry on with the Disney World trip or do we do Disneyland Paris? So, I was debating and some of you might have seen on Instagram I had a giant Christmas cracker arrive from the Disney Destinations team. They sent me a lovely spirit jersey and it was promoting Disneyland Paris at Christmas. And I was thinking to myself, this is a sign. I was already thinking about doing it. Now I've received this. Let's just do it. So, the upcoming Disney trip is now going to be Disneyland Paris rather than Disney World. It will be the Christmas season. We're going to be able to show you the parade, the character meet and greets. They have a tree lighting ceremony, all the decorations. I am so excited. I've been so excited planning something different because I've only been to Disneyland Paris a couple of times. And neither of those trips I did the planning. Becky did it one time and another time I did a press trip which I was very kindly invited on. So, I've never actually planned a trip myself. That's what I've been doing and really really enjoying because it's just something completely different to me. We're going to be doing a few days in Paris as well. Those vlogs will be over on my Victoria in Detail channel and then the Disneyland Paris vlogs here will start once the Disney World trip with Cla finishes. I'm so excited for it. Paul is absolutely buzzing as well. Like I said, he's never been. So, everything will be new to him and I know you guys loved seeing his reaction to Disney World. So, now we're going to have that again for Disneyland Paris. I will be back in Disney World next year. As I said, I've got trips planned in. So, there will be more Disney World vlogs coming and Paul will be coming with me. So, everybody who loved the pool in Disney World vlogs, that will be coming again soon. But, in the meantime, we're going to have Disneyland Paris. So, if you're excited for that, please do give this video a thumbs up. We can't wait to get over there and start experiencing everything. Thank you guys so much for watching. As always, I really, really do appreciate it and everything that you guys do in the way of supporting the channel, supporting the content, supporting me. I really do appreciate each and every one of you. So, a big thank you. I hope you're all well and having a great week and I will see you next week for Hollywood Studios. And Cla and I actually haven't done Hollywood Studios yet on this trip. So that will be our first visit there. So that's coming next Saturday. See you then. [Music] You made your choice. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music]"

      "transcript": "Hey pixies, today we are packing for a Disney World Christmas. I'm going through all of our outfits from mine, the girls, and hubbies and all of the things like that that we are packing. So, if you're trying to figure out how to even pack for Disney World during the Christmas season, lots of layers are going to be involved. So, sharing some of the things that I'm packing and how I am going to mix and match these throughout the trip depending on what and weather throws our way. So, if you are excited, you're getting ready for your own Disney World trip, you have a countdown going, go ahead, click that thumbs up button, and let's jump into the video. So, I have all of the outfits laid out on the bed, ready to kind of show you as we go. I'm going to be trying mine on and also showing you the outfits that I have picked out for my little family. But first, we need to talk accessories. Arguably, the most important part of your Disney World outfit is the shoes. So, these are the two that I am taking. I usually only pack two pairs of shoes for Disney World, but I always want to pack two pairs of shoes unless we're packing personal item only. Then I may go with one only, but as far as typical trips like this, we are going to be there for a full week. So, I want to make sure I can have something to switch out with. I'm going to be taking these tennis shoes. They are on Amazon. Really inexpensive, really comfy. I have broken them in at Disney World themselves. I've wore them full days here running around, chasing the kids, going to the park, doing all the things, getting stuff done, and I absolutely love them. They usually run about $50, but I've also seen them as cheap as $25, which feels like a steal for how comfy these are. But honestly, no matter the price point, I kind of want another pair. And then also have to pack a pair of sandals cuz you don't know if you're going to get 80° days or you're going to get 50some degree days. You can have both within a one week span. You can have both within a two-day span. At Disney World, it can be a little all over the board. So, that's why I like to take a couple of options. These are comfy. I can do full park days in these sandals. I also love that they are adjustable. So, you have the kind of toe strap here that is adjustable and then also the ankle strap. So, if anything feels uncomfortable, just keep adjusting. And I got these to where they feel perfect. I absolutely love these so much and can't recommend either one of these shoes enough. I'll have them linked down below along with everything else. So, if you are interested in checking those out, I'll have those. Next up though, lippies. So, the one I'm wearing right now cuz I always get questions about the lipstick. So, I'm like, I need to include that in the video. But, I have the NYX Fat Oil on right now. This is the color newsfeed. I like it. It is very hydrating, but without being super sticky like typical glosses. You're not like But it's super hydrating. So, it's hard to explain. I just really like this and I have it in so many colors. My lip drawer is literally full of almost every shade they make of this stuff cuz I love it that much. It is super hydrating, super nourishing, feels good. I like it. And then for the most epic, even Taylor Swift is jealous of this red lip. But that is the CoverGirl Outlast Ultimate Lipstick and it is where's the color? It's in color number 130 and it's called wine o'lock and it is so good. I actually found this one thanks to Jessica Braun. She shared it as like an epic lip either last Christmas or the Christmas before last I think is like an ultimate and I'm like she was so right. So I'm glad. So thank you Jess for the recommendation. That is awesome. But seriously love this. It is more of a matte lipstick. Um so I will share that. But it sticks around. Like I can wear this through a full meal. I can snack. I can do all the things and it is still on my lips. So, I literally have to at the end of the day wipe it off with like a baby wipe or makeup remover wipe or something cuz it's staying and it doesn't run like it's not running out onto other parts of my skin which is really great. So, can't recommend this one enough. It is bold. So, if you've ever seen me in a red lip, it's this one. Another way that we're going to be styling these are with jewelry. So, I have some inexpensive I never like to travel with super expensive jewelry. So, I have these little bands, bangles, bracelets. They are stretchy. They're comfy. And so, these are the ones I will interchange. Sometimes I'll wear the whole stack. Sometimes I might wear just a couple. But we have a little bit of variety going on here that I can kind of mix and match with. And I love those. And then for some ear bling, I have these studded bows. They're so cute. So, you can see for like size reference, they are a little bit bigger for me. I know this is not full goddy by any stretch of the imagination for some earrings, but for me they feel a little extra cuz I don't wear earrings all that often, but they're super cute. Love those. And then I also this were on a very big bow trend. All three of these are bow options, but I thought these were super cute. I love the pearls. Love the kind of velvety crushed velvet kind of bow on there. And it is again a stud for example. That's how it looks there. And then last but not least are these basic little hoops. They are just in a little bow size and they're a little more dainty. See if it'll focus on the earring. There we go. Little more dainty when it comes to like sizing and everything. So they are fun. And then also the necklace that I'm wearing. So this is going to be like the bling that I'm taking to interchange with these. They are going to work with literally every single outfit because we have kind of kept it within a color frame of either black, cream, white, red, or green. So, we have like a five color palette and we're just kind of mixing and matching. And that's the beautiful thing about a lot of these is if it's hot, I can kind of interchange some things to make it appropriate for a warmer day. Or if it's getting cold, I have lots of layers that I can kind of mix and match to warm up my outfit if needed. But let's get on to the workout part of this because by the end of this video I will be sweating. I don't know what it is about outfit videos that like make me work out. But it's like it's it yeah trying on clothes gets me sweating. I don't know why. We're I don't know. We're besties. I'm oversharing. Let's get started. Hello travel day. Okay, let me move this. Hold on. There we go. And also I'm filming an outfit video. I'd rather hang out with you guys than do laundry right now. Okay, don't judge me. just ignore that. But we have made it to travel day. So, here in Tennessee, it is kind of chilly already. It is 60 outside and I can't step outside without a jacket. It's just it's starting to be cool. So, we're doing this in layers. This is also a jacket. It's got some red in it. It's again got some green in it. So, I can pair it with anything. But, I also have a white t-shirt that again I can pair with a lot of different things with this outfit. I've got some green leggings, some dark green, and I am wearing my sandals. So, these are my tactical sandals. I'm just going to suck it up and my toes may be a little chilly, but we are going to attempt as long as the weather is warm enough. Fingers crossed. I'm going to attempt a water park day. So, this has me in my shoes that I will already need once we are at Disney. So, I'm not having to change out of tennis shoes into those. It's not a huge deal, but I just want to be ready to go to the water park. So, that is kind of the plan. got on the little gold hoops. This is super comfy. I love that this is cozy. Again, if it is cool enough at Disney that I feel like I need a jacket like this, I've got one with me. And then for travel days, it is perfect to have an extra layer. Let me take it off really quick and I'll show you the t-shirt. At least one side of it. It's kind of an oversized. I think this is kind of a dol I think they call this dolman. I think. But it's nice. It's flowy. croppedish without being like cropped cuz you you don't want to see all of that, but it's a little bit longer in the back. Not full booty coverage for leggings or bike shorts, but it does have a little bit of coverage going on in the back. Super comfy. I love this shirt so much. Like, I want it in every color. It's really good. But that is the outfit. Really easy. And then I'm going to be able to keep on the shirt and change the pants to this fun skirt. So, it looks like a skirt in the front, but then in the back it is shorts. So, super comfy. I can wear the shirt again. I can change the shirt if I wanted to into even I could wear a tank or anything with it if it is warm enough. But again, rocking the sandals or I can change into uh tennis shoes after our water park. We're hoping to do maybe some Disney Springs time that evening. So, we will see. But this is kind of my idea. This does come in a two-piece set. So, there's also a top that goes with this, but I didn't care super for I didn't care for it a ton when I wore the two-piece together. So, I'm kind of separating it and wearing it like this. So, this is travel day outfit and then evening of the travel day outfit. And then when it comes to the family's travel day outfits, I have husband the fun green t-shirt. It is a simple shirt. He can throw on a hoodie or jacket of his choosing. He's got a couple of shets that he could wear with this and it would look really nice and also pair well with a lot of the shirts that I have picked out for him. So, we've got that going on. And then the girls are wearing a matching ensemble. So, they're not twins, but they like to dress like they're twins. So, grabbed this t-shirt. Still has the tags on. It was like I think around $6. I'll have everything that I can linked down below or you can scan the QR code right here and shop along with any of the outfits that I have. So, this one is North Pole. I feel like either a little girl or a little boy could wear this one. It says North Pole Sleigh Rides, and it's super cute. It is long sleeve, so it is going to have a little bit more of warmth to it. It's not super thick to be super warm, but especially on the airplane, it seems to get a little chilly. And then I do have them these ribbed red pants. They are flares. And again, this is something it is a lightly fleece lined on the inside, so super soft. But again, this is something I can have them pair with something if they need to. Um, some of their dresses or anything that might need a little bit of warming up. Like I could pull this dress and put these on under it and they'd be great. They could do their Minnie Mouse Christmas dresses, have that underneath. And so that is my goal with these is anything that can mix and match with each other. That's the game plan that we're going with so that everybody is comfortable cuz I don't want to get there. And you have prepared for warm weather cuz Florida's always hot and then you're cold or you prepare for cool weather cuz you're thinking Christmas is cold. Not in Florida. So it just really depends. So this is kind of my plan of action. said, \"Let's keep going with the outfits.\" Oo, totally forgot to do the other half of that outfit. So, for Dean and the girls for the night that we're going to Disney Springs, they are going to be wearing these little dresses. They're bows with little stars on them. To me, this is really giving almost a Star Wars vibe. So, you could totally wear this if you were going to G Galaxy's Edge and kind of theming your outfits to that. I think these are super cute. So, those are fun and I think they're going to enjoy those. And then for that evening, Dean is going to wear a red polo. Really easy. Obviously, it's a good basic. It goes with a lot of different things. And it nothing is We've got some Disney things sprinkled in. We've got Disney theming, but nothing is screaming, I couldn't put this on and wear it anywhere I wanted to. If you were like, I want Disney 24/7 all the time, that is great. But also, I feel like these are good staple pieces that going to a regular holiday party where you don't want to be like a Disney person, you can do that. So, this is going to be my outfit. So, let's head into the bathroom. Also, before we go very much further into the video, I did want to say hi. My name is Ashley. If you are new, if you're not, welcome back, fam. I am so glad you're here and you clicked on another video and you're hanging out with me. If you are new, I'm so happy you clicked on the video, too. Thank you for being here. I'm so excited here on my channel, Pixie Dusted Mom. I'm Ashley. Also, I've never done this, obviously. My name is Ashley, and my channel here is Pixie Dusted Mom, and I share all kinds of tips, tricks, and hacks for prepping, packing, and enjoying Disney World as a family. So, we have two little girls. I am a mom of a four-year-old and a six-year-old, and me and my husband absolutely love traveling to Disney World with them. We have been taking them um ever since my oldest was one year old and my youngest was 6 weeks old. So, we have traveled with a lot of ages and we go pretty frequently considering we are not locals to Disney. We do live in Tennessee. So, we absolutely love it and I would absolutely love you to be a part of the internet fam. So, if you can click that red subscribe button below or if you are watching on a TV, which actually a lot of you are nowadays, which is really cool. I feel like I've like arrived. I'm on the big screen. But you can pull out your phone, scan this handy dandy QR code that's popped up here on the screen with your phone and the camera and it will pull you over to my page. So you can click that red subscribe button right there. But we would absolutely love to have you in our internet fam. So thank you again for being here. Thank you for watching and now let's continue on with the video. So this is kind of what I'm thinking for our Magic Kingdom day. So I have my denim bow skirt. I do have to give a disclaimer. If you are purchasing this skirt, please size up two. Not not one, but two full sizes, you guys. Yeah. And I'm not going to get get all in it. I don't like sizing, but I had to size up. So, let's just say that this is an XL. I usually wear a small medium. Ordered the medium. It wouldn't even zip and it had like inches. And I'm like, listen, I've put on some pounds. I will be the first to admit that stress and hormones and all these things, like 30 looks a little different than 20 did, but here we are. That's a whole other topic for another another day. But it is one of those I did have to size up. So, don't feel bad when you have to size up. Also, just know you're going to have to size up. So, I've got this. I have the bow. I need to find my nude colored um bike shorts to go underneath this cuz this is just a skirt. So, for me personally, I like to wear some little nude colored bike shorts under my skirts, especially when we're going to Disney and I'm chasing the kids around and like bending over and that sort of thing. So, it kind of makes it into almost an athletic dress without having to be an athletic dress. I do love this button short sleeve top. So, it does give a little bit of like a cozy vibe to it with being kind of Christmy, but it's also something that it's going to be fine in warm weather. So, I love that it's a little bit longer in the back. I did the millennial faux tuck in the front so we could highlight the bow on the skirt. So, I know I know I'm showing my millennial, but then I also, if I didn't want to do red, I have this knit green option. So, you guys will have to let me know which one, sorry, you think is better. So, we've got the knit green. No buttons, cropped about the same length, maybe a little bit less. And it's all one length where this one is longer in the back. This one is not. So, I don't know. You have to let me know on outfit number three. Red or green. I don't know. We'll see. See what we go with for the family. For this Magic Kingdom outfit, the girls are going to be rocking their little dresses that have Christmas lights on them. They've got Mickey, Donald, Minnie, Goofy, Daisy. I think's on here and or maybe not Daisy. Yeah, not Daisy. Pluto's on here. It's got a bunch of the fab Disney characters on there. So, that is what they will be rocking. I'm going to pair that with some little bike shorts underneath so they are comfy. And then also, again, like I mentioned earlier, if they need some warmth, I can also bring in those pants that they had on. And then hubby got a new shirt for this outfit, but it is a checkered look. It is red. feel like this can go either like gingerbread, you're cooking in the kitchen, Christmas, or it could totally go picnic blanket for Fourth of July. So, it's kind of serves multiple purposes. Really soft, really comfy, and he's going to look so handsome in it. Now, we've changed for our evening at Animal Kingdom. I love this set cuz it looks like a dress, but it's on the side, and it's knit. It's this really fun like knit material. Super stretchy, super breathable. But again, I like that it kind of looks like a little dress, but it's not. Also, my millennial is crying in these socks. I cannot decide, you guys, if I am a crew sock kind of person. I don't know. You guys will have to let me know in the comments like yes, no. I feel like I'm too short for crew socks and it makes me look like I have stubby legs. You're not going to offend me if you agree with me and say that yes, girl, it does make your legs look super stubby. I don't know how people pull this look off. Maybe they're taller. Maybe I'm just gonna look stubby. I don't know. My But my millennial is seriously crying not having on ankle socks. I'm also like cringing at the thought of the tan lines I'm going to get from this thing. But this is the outfit. So, let me show you what the fan bam's wearing, too. For the girls and hubby, I've got him. He has this kind of creamy tan color polo with the white trim kind of piping around the collar that he is going to wear. So, I've got that one. And then the girls saw these dresses the other day at Walmart. They were on clearance, so I don't know how long they're going to last and got them for either five or $6 in our store, but they're so cute. They are white, so I'm like boy, I can just see Mickey bar up and down this thing. But it it's okay. We got it on clearance. It's not a big deal. This is also why I I I love these like $100 dresses, $150 dresses. I'm like, they are freaking gorgeous. The designers are fantastic. They are works of art, but all I see is it going to play condition the very first time that thing hits a park. And I'm like, I can't spend that much. and they like instantly go to play condition. So that's just me. That's is I guess it's my cheap sideeshow. And I love I love a good dress. It's like the more that has happened with even $50 dresses, I'm like I don't really want to spend that much. So that's just kind of where I'm at. But these are super cute. They do have the tulle skirts. So super flowy. Just pairing again pair of bike shorts with this and it's going to be super cute. But I love it. It kind of works with the whole neutral Christmas that we're going for here with this look. So, that is that. Let's move on to the next day. Next up, we are on to our resort day. So, I did throw in a layer of a kind of knit sweatshirt. It is a little bit cropped. And then these shorts. They do have pockets on the outside. I do feel like these run a little bit small to be honest. I feel like I might should have instead of gotten a getting a medium, probably should have got a large so that they would hang a little looser to be perfectly honest. So yeah, that would be my only change is I think I would size up. But I love these cuz they do look like a skirt even though they are shorts which is kind of cool. I like that I did ditch the tall socks this time though. I don't know. I can't decide. I think they look so cute on so many people but I just I don't know about them on me. And then it changed into the bow earrings there. You can see. So, this is my outfit. I can also change this out with a t-shirt. This is probably what I'll wear on our resort day for doing more like evening stuff, going to Disney Springs, whatever we decide to get into that evening. And then if we do the pool that morning, that kind of thing, obviously, we'll just be throwing on a cover up and a swimsuit. But let me show you what I have paired for this outfit for the rest of the family for the fam bam on our first resort day. I have a black polo for the hubby. It's kind of a ribbed style. So, this is actually just a lot of these pieces are pieces I've pulled from our closets kind of pairing them with a few new things. But do have these for the girls. I showed these little skirts. These are new finds this year, but they are little metallic skirts. I will have to fit some bike shorts under these because they are short. They are skirts, not squirts. I was fully expecting a skirt. And then I checked and I'm like, it's just a skirt. But for my little girls and running and playing on a resort day specifically, we'll probably be at the playground or running around having fun. They they need some shorts on under this thing. But got Bella to pair with that. She was so excited about this. If you have a little animal lover, this one may be your kids favorite, too. But she loves Marie. She loves Figaro. She loves Lady Pluto. So, it's got all the kind of kitties and puppies on here and it's so cute. So, she's so excited about that. And it is Christmas themed cuz they've got like little Santa hats and reindeer ears and presents and things with it. So, that's adorable. And then got the same skirt for my older daughter. And then she is pairing this little bow shirt with it. And it's got the kind of glittery gold bow. So, I figured that would pair nicely with that. And now we are on to our Jollywood night outfit. I'm so excited. I've not tried on this dress. So, we're getting first experience together. I'm a little nervous to be honest. Okay, so this is comfy. Like I fully expected it. It is loose, so there's no stretch, nothing. And I know I do like I did like this. I have a food belly, you guys. Okay, it is not anything else. So, don't be Oh my gosh, Ashley's expecting. I'm not, trust me. But this is a long dress. For some people, it's a midi. I'm 5'3, so it is not a midi on me. It's an ankly. Um, so we're going with the hat. I do have my tennis shoes on. I don't know if I'll wear the tennis shoes or the sandals. I guess it depends on the temperature, but I do love that it has pockets, so that's awesome. I loved the neckline. It felt kind of retro to me and especially for Jollywood nights. It also had that glam without being super like fancy, overly stiff kind of thing. Um cuz I'm like the flapper dresses and all that look so pretty, but I just I don't know that I'm going to wear a flapper dress again. You know what I mean? Like this I could wear and also it's so comfortable. I could throw this on with a little sweater or a cardigan and wear it around the house if I wanted to. Like I could seriously see like cleaning and doing housework or anything in this dress. It is so stinking comfortable. Like it feels like I'm wearing pajamas, but it doesn't look like pajamas. So, I'm really excited about this one. Also, if I am wearing this and it is going to be cooler for our Jollywood party, I can throw on that cropped sweater that I just had on and it would look so cute with this. And the skirt would totally work out for adding some warmth to this. But if it is warm, I'm still going to be super comfortable in this. So, okay. I love this. 10 out of 10. Definitely recommend. Love this dress so much. Like, and also, I feel like this would be great even next summer. I'm like, Fourth of July party, here I come. I feel like I need to host a cookout for the fan bam for Jollywood night. Got Pubby a black polka dot shirt. So, he's going to look handsome. So, I'm very excited about that. It is super cute, super soft. Got this one for our youngest. And I'm probably going to have her do her Christmas photos in this dress. And heck, I might actually even wear this for her Christmas photos. We'll see what I do. But I think this one is so pretty. Kind of kills two birds with one stone, so to speak, as the saying goes. So, I can use this for our jollywood and then again for again Christmas photos. But, I just think this is such a beautiful dress. So inexpensive but yet so gorgeous. So love that. And then have this dress for Lucy. It's kind of a little strap on one side, ruffles on the other side. It has the stars on it. So it's glam without being overly uncomfortable. But those are so cute. I'm so excited about our outfits. I know that this is the least important part about it, but I enjoy a good outfit and I don't really plan outfits a lot for home and so like Disney is the one time I do that and I really love it. I should honestly do it more at home. I don't know why I don't but for me, I don't know, Disney just I feel like it just brings it out. Our next resort day, I was thinking this athletic dress. It's kind of a berry red. You do have the tulleish skirt over the built-in shorts. Now, these are built in. There's no easy access kind of pull down from the back to go potty and they are not separate. They are built in. So, there's that issue. You do have to do the little one piece swimsuit. You I don't know. You know, I just I always questioned that when I first started seeing athletic dresses. I'm like, but how the heck are we peeing in these? So, I'm just saying that's the way it is. It does not have a built-in bra, which from the front it pretty well disguises the bra, but then the straps, sorry, I got to move the camera so you can see, but the straps kind of go in a different direction. And it is a crisscross back. So, I'll probably end up doing some sort of sticky bra situation with this. That would be the only thing that would make this dress even better is if it had built-in pads. That would be nice. super supportive, super like it's very adjustable straps so you can make it fit however you need to wearing it with the tennis shoes here. But I love this one. Super comfortable and it does have that kind of flowy skirt. So I really like this style. I've got a couple of the skirt options or like squirt options that are like this. And so this is my first athletic dress style and I really like it and I think it's so cute. So, Amazon for the win on the cute stuff for the family's outfit for this particular day. I've got Hubs in this collared shirt, short sleeve. So, that is the style kind of he is going with. It is a button-up shirt as you can see, but those are super comfortable and look really nice for him. And then the girls, I showed these in my prepping video before this, but they do have these pretty kind of winter floral dresses. They are long sweet long sleeve, but they are really comfy play dresses, which is great. Again, this is for a resort day. So, we'll be at the playground. We're going to Disney Springs or maybe playing mini golf or doing something fun. So, that is kind of the idea with that. It does have little pockets for them, which is cute. But, love those. I'm just going to pair it with some bike shorts and they will be super cute and comfy in these. Honestly, I love that print so much. Like I wish they would make something like that in an adult size cuz I would totally twin with them with that cuz I think it's really cute. Now we are on to the very merry outfit. So going with a comfy athletic dress cuz this is going to be a long and late night for us. So it has kind of spaghetti or not spaghetti straps but does have kind of tank style straps. They are not adjustable, but it does kind of have a scoop back there. Not super low, but it does have a little bit. And then it is a subtle V. It's not a harsh V, but I feel like it's more of a subtle V neck. It is padded, which is great. So, you don't have to worry about wearing a bra when you're throwing this on. You can quickly do so. I love the coverage. It comes down to just above my knees at 53. So, it' be a little bit shorter obviously if you are taller and you have a longer like torso section, that sort of thing. So, obviously it's going to be different. But on this one, I'm not about to flash you, I promise. But I will I do have to share it does have shorts underneath. They are not separate in the front, but they are separate in the back, which is really cool. So, you can go potty, which is nice. um the things I share on the internet. But it also has pockets underneath, which is always kind of weird to me cuz I feel like when I like hike my skirt up to put something in here, I just always feel so self-conscious about it. I'm like feel like I'm getting looks from people. But you do have a pocket if you needed to put yourself on in it. I wish it had an exterior pocket, but it does kind of keep the dress a little more streamlined not having that, but it does have that. Let me see. I think it has it. Yeah, it's on both sides, which is really nice. This is super comfortable, super stretchy. I will say I do feel like these run slightly large. So this is a medium and for me I have a little bit of kind of extra over here. It fits good in other places but in this area it is a little small. I am part of the itty bitty titty club. So you know I'm not filling it out super great either. So that might be part of the reason why I have this little bit of gapping over here. I'm just telling you before you buy the dress this is kind of what you're working with. I love the dress. I would buy it again. But just a heads up about that part. Per usual for the family's outfit. Both of the girls are going to be wearing this little bow headband. They absolutely loved these. This would also, again, I said this in the prepping video, I think, but these would be so cute if you're doing a Snow White outfit. So, just a heads up and an idea. And then we have the little Christmas tree style dresses. They come in red and then they also come in this super super cute green color which is adorable. I love it so much. And then for the hubby, he does have this plaid shirt. Had to bring in some plaid for Dean. So if you know, you know. He loves his plaid. So we got that. It is long sleeves, so he can roll up the sleeves. And if it is cooler that or if it is warmer, then he can pair it with shorts, which is probably what he'll pair it with anyway. Usually his go-to is black shorts. It's like staple, but we've got that. It is nice. And then also, again, this is something he can wear on the daily at home. So, super cute. And I like this. It is really soft flannel, too, cuz sometimes flannel can be really itchy, and this one is not. So, love that. We are on to the second to last outfit. This is the next um resort day. I think we're doing maybe two resort days. We are annual passholders, so we'll see if we pop into the parks, but our kind of idea is a rough draft resort day. that have this t-shirt that this is the red version of the white one I showed in the beginning of the video. It's this really pretty berry red and I love it. Do have it paired with the little skirt like I was talking about earlier. It's kind of like that um red dress that I had earlier. It does have pockets in the side. I don't think it has it. Nope, they do have it on both sides which is nice. I also love that it has a little bit of tummy control with the wide waistband going on here. It is really nice for that. Kind of sucks you in a little bit. If you have had children, then you kind of understand the midsection struggle. But that's where we're at. This one is super cute, super comfortable. And again, it's very Christmassy. And then I can add, if I wanted to add ears or anything extra super Disney jewelry, whatever to this, can totally kind of disify it up a little bit. But this is going to be great. And also, if it is on the cooler side of things, I can throw that jacket on with this or one of my sweaters. I can switch out the skirt if I wanted to do the shirt and do some of the leggings like I wore on our travel day. I can also insert some of those into this situation and warm up the outfit just a little bit. And for this resort day for the family, we're back to this one again. I do have this shirt. We actually grabbed this on clearance, which is great. So, if you're going and you need clearance shorts, shirts that are short sleeve, anything like that for your Disney trip, definitely check stores right now cuz it's going to be like dirt cheap. I was getting some of the girls like bike shorts and things at Target the other day for $1.50 a piece. I got Dean some green shorts to wear with one of his outfits for $6, you guys. Like, it is seriously the time to buy. If you are needing stuff for next year, shop ahead. go ahead and grab some of that stuff this year instead of waiting until next summer and paying full price. Especially Staples t-shirts, shorts, those kinds of things, I think that's great. So, if you can do it and you can find it, snag some. So, this is his. It's kind of a white shirt. It does have a um I think that's black. I believe that is black. I don't think it's navy. Yeah, that's black. It has that black kind of stripe to it. It has it on the sleeves of the shirt as well. Super soft. This is some sort of like resort collection, so it's really breathable. So, if it is warm, he's going to be so comfortable in this shirt. And then grab these dresses for the girls. They are kind of a sweatery material, so they will be a little warmer. But it is a dress. So, and it's also, honest to goodness, it's not super thick. Like, you can see my face through it. You can see light through it. So, it's not uber thick that they're just going to be boiling if it is warm. And also they can wear some little bike shorts under it. Be super comfortable. Roll the sleeves up if we needed to. But those are so darling. Again, this is another thing I feel like you could also wear this um right now even for Halloween if you needed like a little Halloween outfit. I feel like it works for that. Or you could do it and for me this is giving almost Hollywood Studios. So you could wear it to Hollywood Studios too. I think that's super cute. So all right, we are on to the last and final outfit and that is the Epcot outfit. So, going to go through that really quickly and then that's going to round off the video. Oh, and bags. We've not talked about bags yet. How did I forget those? Before I show you this outfit, I did want to talk bags. So, when my husband and I went on our solo parent trip to Disney, I used this as my little purse. He had a um backpack that he carried with the rest of our stuff in it, but this was like quick, easy stuff like lip gloss, your phone, your hand sanitizer, wipes, all that good stuff. with the kids, I would have to be very particular about what I kept with me, but I feel like I could make this work. It gives kind of a higherend look for less. And also, you can take the long strap piece off if you are more of a shoulder bag kind of gal. I'm a millennial, so it's got to be a cross body. Okay, I ain't got time to be like shoulder bagging this stuff. Like, but I'm old now, so what do I know? The other option, and I may I usually I don't take two bags. I probably won't, but this is been my go-to ever since I got it. It is the perfect bag. Holds a ton of stuff. You got Pringles and such a This is the epitome of a mom bag right now. I have Pringles in here. I have Goldfish. I have LCD tablets. And I have glow sticks. Tell me you're a mom without telling me you're a mom. So, this is this is the the thing. But I do h I love that it has the wipes pouch and so I can just open this flap, grab it. If I'm wearing it and I'm doing something and hubby needs to grab a wipe, he can easily like open the flap, grab a wipe as well. Only thing is I need to wash this strap. It has seen a lot of sweat, Disney sun, and fake tanner. So, we've got to wash that one. Okay, now let's show you the outfit. Those two bags though, love them both. That's It's like the ultimate mom bag. If you need a good bag, that mom bag fan freakingastic. Also comes in black. I just need it to come in cream. That would be so pretty. For the Epcot outfit, I'm going ahead and kind of layering this a little thicker. So, I would be able to button this shirt up. I love that it's kind of a pepleum top. It's almost a corduroy without being a thick corduroy. It is kind of ribbed style. I can unbutton it, roll up the sleeves, or button it. And this would be a nice outside layer. Or I can take this off if it is warm and just rock the shirt here. Slip one side off so you can see it that way. But it is just a tank top. Does have the ruffle hem. This is super comfortable. Wore this to Disney in September. And I absolutely love it. So comfy. Does have pockets. Fits great with the sandals. So I really really like this one. Again, it it wears great. You could I feel like even if you had like a job where you had to kind of dress up, you could totally rock this there as well. So, I think this one's cute. But let me show you the girls and Dean's outfit for this outfit and for our Epcot day. And that's going to be all of it. And now I get to go pack it. Yes. Because when things are officially going in the packing cubes and going in the suitcase, that means the trip is coming up super soon. I'm so so excited. But to show you guys, this is what the girls will be wearing. It's this literally the same dress as the mini dress that I just showed you, but this one has Marie on it. So, if you have any Marie fans, this one's for them. Super cute. Does have the tulle skirt, a little bit of gold glitter on it as well. Super super cute. Long sleeves, but again, it is not uber thick. We can see you can see right through it. You can see that that like you can see where my tank top and stuff is from the back side of it. It's a little thicker on the front for coverage, but as far as the back, it is breathable, which is really cute. Love that for them. And then have this shirt, more plaid for Dean. It's a short sleeve style this time, so if he needs to add a shet or something with it, he can to warm up his outfit. But if it is hot, then he'll be just fine with this plaid button-up shirt here. And again, it's stuff that he can wear all the time, which is great. So, that is going to do it though for the outfits, what we're packing for Christmas. I hope you guys enjoyed the video. If you did, don't forget, click that thumbs up button, the red subscribe button if you are not already part of the internet fam, and those of you that are still here, you are now part of my honorary end of the video club. So grateful for you guys. So, you will have to drop me some snow emojis in the comment section. That way, I know you're part of the secret end of the video club cuz I'm so excited for the snow at Disney. I think it's so magical. It's going to be so fun. And you guys will also have to let me know with your emojis for your little snow. When is your trip countdown? Are you going to be going for the holidays? Are you going to see it at Christmas? Is it on your bucket list to see it at Christmas? But thank you again for watching and I will see you guys right back here in the next video. Bye, guys."

      "transcript": "You could do everything right. Plan ahead. Wake up early. Buy your lightning lanes, but still waste half of your Disney World trip. Although, not if you know these pro hacks. We're going to start with the easy, simplest ones and then work our way up to the tips that can save you some serious time, money, and frustration. Let's start with something that seems pretty simple and straightforward, but actually makes a huge impact. The posted weight times on rides. not always 100% accurate. Knowing the true weight time means you're not just standing around in line while other people are actually on rides. Knowing how to understand weight times is one of the easiest ways to save an hour or more in your Disney day. We're going to talk about it. Okay. But why would the weight times not be accurate? Sometimes Disney inflates the wait time so that guests have a better experience. If your weight ends up being a little bit shorter than you're expecting, you're probably going to be a little bit happier. But it also has to do with crowd control and being able to move people around the park. So if you walk by a ride and you see that the wait time is posted as 60 minutes and you're like, \"Wait, really?\" Maybe trust your eyes. I've been to Disney World about 650 times. Like no joke, I live like 30 minutes away from the parks, so I'm here a lot. And what I found pretty consistently is that wait times are about 10 minutes less than they're actually posted like. However, that's all to say that it's not always the case. So, be mentally prepared to wait the full wait time amount. And if you end up waiting less, think of it as a happy surprise. there being a 20 minute wait time for space man. I think the app said 35 with for Tron which is absolutely insane. So today is not really helping my case but normally normally this applies. Now, I actually wasn't going to talk about this, but kind of impromptu little hack here is the reason why the wait times are so low right now is because there is a special event tonight. And so, normal day guests are often leaving the park right now and special event guests have not all quite got here yet. So, there is an in between where you can sometimes find pretty darn good weight times. Figured we take advantage of these short wait times today. And something that can help you determine and understand is this a short wait time is to start galactic travelers. Welcome aboard the people movement by enterprise is to start understanding the patterns of wait times. For example, a 25minut wait time for the little mermaid might sound short. For a lot of Disney World rides, it would be, but it's actually kind of high for this ride specifically. So, start noticing wait time patterns for attractions or rides you're interested in before your trip begins. You can use the My Disney Experience app to start scouting this out ahead of time. Even if you're nowhere near Disney World, you can still get this information, which also kind of makes it fun because it helps you kind of feel like you're having the magic even when you're at home. But you could also use third party sites. Please contact tower to confirm your flight to the moon. Thank you. Now, I'll talk about my favorite third party app in just a little bit. Also, baby pro tip, the People Mover is awesome at night because your eyes will be better adjusted to the darkness, so you'll be able to see a little bit more inside of Space Mountain. Oh my gosh, that was maybe the happiest thing I've seen in a long time at Disney World. I didn't know that Chip, which I don't know where Dale is. If he's around, he's over there. Wait, hold on. Hey, Dale. You're so cute. But I didn't know you had your Kimble's face outfit on. They look so handsome. He looks so handsome. Muscles. Thank you. Okay, I can just cry now. That was so cute. So, I didn't know Chip and Dale were doing roaming around Tomorrowland, and I certainly did not realize they were in their super cute space outfits. Oh my goodness. I've got to figure out a way to compose myself now. Although, this next thing could seriously make or break your entire Disney day. And it's something that is so underestimated. It can lead to things like missing a lightning lane ride window or a dining reservation you worked so hard to get. Most guests don't build in enough buffer time for transportation, but the pros always do allow for way more time than you think to get anywhere at Disney World. One transportation quirk that can really catch people offguard, especially if you are park hopping or you have a dining reservation at a resort. During the first 2 hours or so after Magic Kingdom opens, the express Montreal only goes from the ticket and transportation center to the Magic Kingdom. Like, you can't take that back. Okay, back to the Magic Kingdom Montreal. It's a tiny move, but it can save you a solid 10 minutes. But even more than that, it can give you an amazing first look at the Magic Kingdom. If possible, if you're at the ticket and transportation center and you are heading towards the Montreal, head to the right side of the platform and as far down as you can towards the end of the Montreal. Even though it feels like the back of the Montreal, this location actually allows you to hop off quickly and head down the stairs. You'll be down the ramp and ahead of the crowds before they even realize which direction they're headed. And we're heading to Magic Kingdom. Then you can walk up to the Mickey touch points like a boss. Your next stop will be the Magic Kingdom. When it comes to your Disney day, one of the most important things is food. This one tweak gives you better food and better vibes. It's also essential to take a break during a long Disney day. And what better time to do so than during a meal. Now, if I'm at Magic Kingdom, snacks all day. But when it comes to a full meal, I'm actually not eating at Magic Kingdom for table service and even sometimes quick service meals. I'm getting right back on that Montreal and heading to Steakhouse 71 at the Contemporary Resort or Grand Fian Cafe, even for iconic treats like the Dole Whip. You can probably find me hitting up Pineapple Lai at Disney's Polynesian Resort because you'll get better food, better atmosphere, and it's way less chaotic than trying to navigate Adventure Land with melting Dole Whip. Once you've mastered where to eat, now it's time to master how to plan. There are so many great tools out there to help you understand like average weight times and what are the best lightning lanes to pick out. Even the My Disney Experience app has forecasted weight times in it. But it's not just the Disney app, which has its own laundry list of hacks and tips, and we could do a whole video on that alone. So, let's talk about my favorite tool to track all of this. It shows historic Lightning Lane sellout times, meaning when do certain rides with Lightning Lane typically fill up their Lightning Lane capacity? that can help you plan and prioritize your Lightning Lane strategy. It also talks about average weight times and helps you get an understanding of the crowd levels at different days and time of year. Now, I'll warn you, it's a lot of data, but if you are a numbers geek like me, Thrill Data is the website to go to because our Disney time is precious and we want to make the most of it. I once booked a stay at Disney's Yacht Club because there was a great rate and your girl is always looking for a good Disney discount. Only after I booked, I realized that the pool, which is basically like a mini water park, was actually going to be closed while I was there. Now, fortunately, I was able to quickly adjust that to stay at Animal Kingdom Lodge, which is amazing. Since the pool at the Yach Club to me is one of the main reasons to stay there, I would have been hugely disappointed. So, that's why it's so important to know what's going to be closed or down while you're on your Disney World trip. That way, you can manage expectations and avoid surprises like that because those are not the fun kind of surprises. Know ahead of time which rides or parts of hotel or even entertainment that's going to be closed during your Disney World trip by checking the Disney website, primarily the Disney parks blog website or by keep watching this channel because I'm always bringing you the latest Disney World strategies here so you can keep creating magical memories. But it's not really things like the rides themselves that are magical. Rather, it's the memories we make while we're here. And a big part of that are the people. You know, your family, the friends you make while waiting in line, and of course, the cast members. They're the Disney difference. I say it almost every video, but it's so true. And something we can do is show appreciation for them. And if a specific cast member makes your day, make sure to leave them a cast compliment. Make a note of their name and their hometown on their name tag. That way, you can give the rockstar cast member the acknowledgement they deserve. You can leave a cast compliment by visiting guest relations or by clicking a button on your My Disney Experience app. Whether it's a cast member that went above and beyond to make you smile, taking two seconds to show kindness leads to unforgettable memories. Those are the moments that last. Those small, quiet ones that remind you why Disney truly is the most magical place on earth."

      "transcript": "I I [Music] take me home today. Take me out to play. Take me back into the sweet sweet. Good morning everyone and welcome to a brand new Disney in Detail vlog. Today is a Saturday and Cla and I are going to be spending some time at the resorts this morning. I often do that on a Saturday cuz the parks can be a bit busier. So, we're going to be going to the Grand Fian and maybe grabbing some lunch there, having a look around cuz Cla's never been. Then over to Pop Century and Art of Animation cuz again that is somewhere that Cla really wanted to see. And then we're going to be going to Coronado Springs eating at Three Bridges. And then tonight we're going back to the Magic Kingdom to see the new Starlight Parade. I am absolutely buzzing to see that. It's been so long since we've had a nighttime parade in the Magic Kingdom. I remember Spectro Magic and the Main Street Electrical Parade. I loved having nighttime parades. So, it is amazing that that's back. I can't wait to see it. And because we're doing some resort hopping today, I have bought my refillable mug. You can use them at all of the resorts. So, it's not just the one you're staying in. So, if you are going to be doing that and going around to a few different ones, definitely bring this with you and then you can get all of your drinks all day and you don't need to pay any extra for them. So, you can definitely make use of this. I love getting good value out of my resort refillable mug. I mean, if you're on the dining plans, you do get this included or you can just pay for it. I think it was $25 for the duration of the trip. So, if you do use every day and you get your coffee in it in the morning, CLA gets hot chocolate at night, you can get your drinks, like I say, if you're going to other resorts. So, it's well worth it. If you're staying in a room that's miles away from the lobby and the food court where the machine is, then maybe not. But if you're close enough, then it's good. And speaking of refillable mug, I'll get a drink as I'm going past. This is my favorite thing ever. The acai blueberry pomegranate. In the UK, we have a range of cleaning products which are pomegranate scented called Inos. And they smell exactly like this drink. So, I use those at home to remind me of it. I'll link it below if you're interested, but it does smell just like this drink. And by the way, the ears that I'm wearing today were very kindly gifted to me by Ears Ever After. I've got them on with this rainbowy dress. I think they go perfectly with it. So, I will link them below. Found Claire. She was just in the shop finding about 17 things that she likes. I have quite a problem. I don't know what ones to buy. Yeah, we can't have it all. So, I have to be selective. I've actually seen a sweatshirt that I like as well. There are actually clothing wise loads of things that I've seen this trip. So, we have to be selective. We're just waiting for our bus. It's actually saying it's going to be about 20 minutes for Magic Kingdom bus. Whether that's true or not, I don't I think it's about 15. That's not too bad. Then, we're going to get the bus to Magic Kingdom, then get on the Montreal. Actually, maybe not the Montreal because then we'll have to do the whole loop. Maybe the boat. Well, yeah, cuz I haven't done that before. So, let's do that. Yeah. So, we'll do that and then head off to Pop Century, which I'm staying at in January. So, really excited for that. I've got the dining plan and everything, so I'm going to be doing lots of like videos about all of that. So, that's to come as well. [Music] [Music] There is a lot of construction here at the Grand Pillian and I haven't realized quite how much. So, I'm going to go up so Cla can maybe see get the idea. [Music] [Music] I am excited for this salad. This looks so good. And it's big. This is a big salad. And I've got bacon, edamame, peas, cucumber, tomato, and then an Italian dressing. They did actually have quite a lot of choice of what you could put on it. Yeah, I've got a couple of different things for you. Yeah. And Cla also had chicken on top, or you could have had steak as well. I think she said the cost of mine was $12 with the tax, which I think for a really nice salad for lunch is perfectly. Mine was 14 something. Yeah. So, it's like a couple of dollars extra for the protein, which is not that bad. And it's a lot of chicken they put on CLA's salad. Yeah. And that that amount of dressing is enough as well. You can say how much dressing you want cuz I do find some salads over here have a lot more dressing on than we have back home in the UK. Um so I did say, \"Can I just have a little bit?\" And this is delicious. And like I was saying this morning, because we bought our refillable mugs with us, they've got a Coke Freestyle machine here, so you just get whatever drinks you want as well. I am still contemplating eating the apple danish and a coffee afterwards, but that might be a challenge. It depends how well this salad goes down. And I can see the castle out the window. I only just realized. No way. Mhm. Oh yeah. I hadn't even realized that. This seat that I'm in, I can literally see it right here. And it is glistening. It is. Oh, an amazing view. Okay, now we know why I love this quick service so much. We're just walking out now to go and get a bus to our next resort. And you can kind of see all of these curtains. It's not just the main part of the lobby. There's all this as well. And there just are curtains everywhere, aren't there? It's just very much not its normal stunning self here at the Grand Vidian. So, we're just going to get the Montreal over to the Magic Kingdom again and then we're going to hop on a bus to Pop or Art of Animation, whichever one we really see first. And you can walk between the two. So, we're going to investigate all of that cuz Cla's never been there either. And then we're going to head across to Coronado. We've just refilled our mugs again. I've got a coffee this time. Cla's got a hot chocolate. Yeah. Although it's like super hot. Recently, I've been going and getting one in the evenings and by the time I drink it, it's almost cold. This is boiling. Yeah, my coffee is actually really hot, too. So, it must have been fresh. [Music] There's Pop Centry bus right here, so we're just going to jump on this one. We have arrived at Pop Centry and I was just about to tell Cla the story about Pop Centry and I figured why don't I tell you guys on camera cuz some of you may not know. So originally Pop Century and Art of Animation were both going to be part of the same resort. So there was going to be this side where you have um 50s60s7s 80s and the other side was going to be even earlier. Oh, so earlier years and this side started construction first and or certainly got completed first and the other one still wasn't done. Then 911 happened and tourism trades. So this really is old cuz that is a long time ago now. Yep. And then everything stalled. Tourism just stalled. So they stalled the construction of the other side. And for a long time it just went overgrown. Nothing was happening there. the bare bones of one of the buildings was there and the foundations of the other buildings, but that was it. And the bridge that goes between the two, which we're going to show you, um, was still there, but people couldn't kind of go up right into it or anything, but you could see it really clearly there across the lake. Then they decided to make it into art of animation. So, a completely different concept, separate resort. Yeah. So, they decided to make it a totally separate resort built out of animation. And that is why there is one building which are the Little Mermaid rooms that are regular rooms and all of the others are family suites because that one building had already been built. Ah, so that's why you've got the Little Mermaid rooms there, but it is only just that one section because it was originally supposed to be the other half of Pop Centry. Okay. So that's the story with this resort. Fair enough. And they are joined still by that bridge. You can walk between the two resorts and the Skyliner services both kind of in the middle. So yeah, just thought I would let you know if you didn't know that. A lot of you may know, but that's how the Art of Animation Resort kind of came to be. There is '90s. I was thinking that. I was thinking it was up to the '90s. And I do believe this resort has just had a refurbishment in the lobby. So, I'll be really interested to see what that looks like. Some people have said I have seen that they preferred it before. So, I'm intrigued to get inside and see what we think about that. This resort, I do remember, always smells incredible. It is one of those that just smells so so good. Let's see if they've kept that the same. Look at this golf cart here as well. Love that. Oh, we're not having the best luck here. Everywhere that CLA wants to look at today is behind curtains. So, the refurbishment is still happening as you can see along here. Before they had all the cabinets with the different memorabilia in it. This, I believe, is our first glimpse of the new theming. So, this wall here where you can see Daisy, I think all the way along where these curtains are, it's going to be kind of rethemed similarly to this. I think that looks cool. I think it is very in keeping with the whole pop vibe. Yeah. Yeah, I like it. And there is some more down here. We've now got Mini. And you can see all the retro cars on there. I do like this. I think I will miss the memorabilia though cuz I did really like that. And this is the Everything Pop um shop. And then you've got the food court as well. I actually think this is one of the best like resort stores anywhere. It's so big. And I do love the food court as well. They are bigger than the Allstar ones. So, we'll take a look in there in a second just so you can see what kind of thing you can get. They have done a refurbishment in this shop as well. Looks a little bit different. And they used to do a create your own pasta here. That was so nice. I don't know if they still do it. I'm interested to see. We've got a Loungefly here that I've never seen before. This Bambi one. When you're buying Loungefly bags, always just be careful. This design, for example, the badge is right over the top of Bambi and then you can just see the legs at the top. But look at the difference with this one where you've got Bambi, you know, three times on the front. So, always look through them. Do the same with ears. Sometimes you get ones where the bow is like a little bit off. Always look for the best one cuz they do differ quite a bit if you look at the difference between those two. I love the inside out one as well. I'm still really tempted by this spirit jersey. I do have the black one with the white writing, but I do love this one where it's more kind of subtle with the black text on it like raised up. This is the sweatshirt that I really really love. So I am thinking about it. I may well get that. I would wear that a lot at home through the winter. CLA's just spotted the mug version there of the top as well. That's quite nice. That's a nice size, too. And it and it's just a nice classic Mickey, isn't it? This is the one Cla's got her eye on and is thinking of getting. I do love that. That's nice. Feels nice and warm like for the winter. That would do me good. No good here. No, I think you'd wear that a lot though. They do have some Pop Century specific merchandise as well. There's this tumbler. That's actually really nice. Yeah, it is. Oh, I actually really like that. Yeah, that's good. I do feel like Paul would lose his mind if I bring that home, though. Honestly, the mug situation, he's like, \"Where are they going to live?\" They are nice. Yeah, I love that the resorts now do have specific ears and spirit jerseys and things. I love a bit of resort specific merchandise. We're just in the food court now, and you can see the refurbishment in here where everything's been repainted. I love this. The colors are amazing, aren't they? Yeah, they are great. I like the color. Love it. And here at Pop, they do have shakes. So, they've got a fruit flavored cereal shake, which looks like fruit loops, basically. Various other shakes. They've got specialty iced coffees and teas. So, you can get a latte or cappuccino, macchiato, and all that kind of thing. And let's just show you what kind of thing they have cuz I know a lot of you guys stay here at Pop and will be interested to know this. They have bacon cheeseburger, a plant-based burger, grilled chicken sandwich, chicken strips, barbecue pork sandwich, chili cheese dog, and back here you have drinks, salads and fruit and sandwiches, like grab and go stuff. You also have yogurts and things there. Some cupcakes. The tie-dye cheesecake has been a staple here at Pop Centry for many, many years now. And the Whoopi Monster. They do have some really good bakery items here. These all look amazing. And this is also where you can get the PB&J quasonant. It's $5.99. I've had one of these when I was with Catherine. It is a very heavy quason filled with PB&J. It's amazing. They do have pasta, but it doesn't look like they do the create your own pasta anymore. Grilled chicken parmesan with pasta, penna with meatballs, and meatball sub, but no create your own. And they also do pizza by the slice, or you can buy the whole pizza. A roast turkey dinner special. And then they do have a create your own entree. So you can have chicken, salmon or shrimp with sides which are like rice, beans, broccoli, mashed potatoes and stuff. Then they've got stir fry, Impossible meatloaf, nachos. So they do have plenty of options here. CLA just did point out though they don't have any hot chocolate in the refillable mug station. That's very surprising. There's like you can see the gap next where it should have been. Just walking through the ' 70s building here. I love the giant Mickey with the phone. Yeah, he is cool. Let's get a bit closer and you can see Mickey. In the 80s section, there's a big Roger Rabbit. Oh god. Which I absolutely love. And I just love this as well. There's much bigger kind of theming with the Allstars. It's very open as you walk down through, but here it's a bit more shade as you're walking through. And you do have some cool stuff like this to look at, too. Listen to what it is. I'm having a Guardians moment. Yes. I really I really hope that we have something like this. It's the best guardian. There's Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head. Yeah, this is my favorite of the value resorts for theming. So, that is Pop Century back there. We've just walked through the ' 70s area. You got the lake here and in front of us then is the Skyliner. So, this is the Skyliner station that serves both Pop Century and Art of Animation. So, we're going to carry on walking over this bridge, walk through Art of Animation just so Cla can see that as well. And we've decided to get an Uber to Coronado Springs. Windy. Very windy. It's nice though. It's nice breeze. Although my hair is kind of going crazy. We decided if we do buses to um Coronado, we would have to go from here to like one of the parks. Oh my gosh, look at my hair. I feel like I'm on Guardians. We would have to go to one of the parks and then transfer to Coronado, which would just be like a long time. So, we're just going to get a quick Uber over there cuz we want to eat at Three Bridges. Yes, I Yes, I do. Is this then Little Mermaid that we're coming up to? I think you come right into Nemo. So, this is the closest to the Skyliner. Little Mermaid rooms are probably the furthest. I think they're kind of the furthest from everything. People do complain a little bit about how far they are from the lobby and from everything else. They are a little bit of a walk, I'll be honest. But all of these Nemo rooms are family suites. And then you've got the Lion King section and then the cars section also. And all of those are family suites. There are some options if you need to accommodate more people in the Disney resort. So, if you need a room that will sleep six, you have some of the more expensive options like the treehouse villas. You also have the cabins at Fort Wilderness, but those are more pricey. If you're looking for a budget option, this isn't really a budget option for the family suites. I wouldn't say they are still quite expensive for these Lion King Nemo and Cars suites. Sometimes you can get a good deal, but they are still kind of pricey. One of the lesserk known things though is that Allstar Music do have family suites. They don't have a lot of them, but they do have some and they sleep six. So, if you're looking for that, try and look at Allstar Music. It's only that one. Sports and movies don't have them. And like I said, there's not very many. So, sometimes they might not come up in search, but they do exist and you can sleep six in them. So, that might be a more budget option for you. We just missed the seagulls. They do actually do the mind my mind thing every now and again at the top there. I am now in Landscape of Flavors. Cla has just gone for a little walk around the cars section. I'm just taking a break because I want to conserve my energy for being late in the Magic Kingdom again tonight. The parade is on at 10:30. And obviously with the parade, you have to find your spot and you're then kind of stood there waiting for it for quite a long time. For me, standing is actually a lot more difficult than walking and I did a lot of that last night as well. I absolutely love having a resort hopping day. It's really a good way to chill a little bit if you've been in the parks every single day. And like I say, if this is Saturday and the parks are really busy, I feel like this is a nice thing to do. And it means you can look at different resorts for the future. If you plan on doing future Disney trips, you can take a proper look, look at the food court, look at the pools, and just decide whether it's somewhere that you would like to stay. And it just means that you'll know for next time what things look like. And all of the Disney resorts are great. You can go into any of them, take a look around. The only one that you can't do that is Shades of Green, which is a military resort. So, you can't go in there, but everywhere else you can take a look around, just relax, have something to drink, have something to eat, eat in the restaurants there. So, I would highly recommend doing that if you do have time during your trip just to have a little bit of downtime. I feel like this trip is going so fast. Normally with my Disney trips, the first half will go very slowly and then the second half flies by. This trip, it has just flown by since the minute we got here. I can't believe how many days we've already had. And we have been doing quite a lot, so it's understandable, but it has just flown by. Please do let me know in the comments of this video if there are any specific resorts that you would like us to go to. Are there any that I haven't shown for a while that you want a more in-depth look at? Do let me know in the comments below. I had a message from Becky. She said that she was in Epcot today and she said it's so busy they ended up leaving. She said the lines for all of the food and wine festival booths and even things like Kringler Bakery were like halfhour lines to get in. I haven't actually looked on the app to see what the wait times are. Let's have a look. It's currently 90 minutes for Remy's Ratatouille Adventure. That is kind of high to be fair compared to what we've seen since we've been here. 60 minutes for Frozen, 105 minutes for Test Track. That is quite high. We're going to try and do that tomorrow when we're in Epcot. 90 minutes for Guardians. So, Guardians is less than test track. That does seem kind of odd. Saurin is 25 minutes. That's not too bad. I would say those weight times are on the higher side, though compared to what they have been in the last week to 10 days. The beginning of September is definitely the quietest time. And then it does gradually start to creep back up again. While we're sat here, let's just take a look at the Magic Kingdom and see what the wait times are like there, cuz we are going to be going there fairly soon cuz we are going to be going there this evening. So, it's worth knowing. 75minute wait for Tiana's bio adventure. Obviously during party days we have seen that at like 15 minutes. I've even heard some people have done it with 10 minutes. So obviously 75 is much higher. You can tell it's a nonvent day. 40 minutes for Haunted Mansion. What's that there? 70 minutes for Seven Doors Mine Train. You know that's kind of high as well. Let's have a look at Tron. 70 minutes for Tron. So you can definitely tell the difference between a party day and a non-event day. A lot more people who have just got like a one-day ticket will come on days like today where there's the full agenda of entertainment. You've got the Starlight Parade. You've got Happily Ever After. The park is open past 6:00 p.m. I think the park is open till maybe 11:30 this evening. So, definitely it will be busier on a day like today. It'll be really interesting to see whether we can get a good spot for the parade. Can't wait to see it. I've always really missed Spectro Magic and the Main Street Electrical Parade, so I can't wait to see this new one that Disney have got. I'm so glad they've got a nighttime parade back again. Just realized as well, these ears match perfectly with my refillable mug. You know, I love a matching moment. We're just walking through. Is it Ink and Paint? I think this is called. And again, this is a really big resort store compared to some of them. Goes all the way around here. I won't look around this one. has probably largely got the same stuff as the Pop Centry one. Unless they might have some Art of Animation specific stuff. Let's look at that. There's a mug there and a Tumblr. I think I do prefer the Pop Century stuff. They do have a Loungefly bag though. I do love the lobby area here at Art of Animation. It's really cool. They have all this neat artwork all the way down. And this is where the check-in desk is. We've made it to Grand Theest Tower and Cla loves Coronado Springs. It's like your favorite. It is. This is me like home. Cla loves this resort. And my only experience that you guys will remember in January in my very sad trip where I was poorly, I did stay here at the tower and had a view of the fireworks. Um, but I was unwell. So, I definitely want to come back to experience this another time. But, Grandino Tower here is just absolutely stunning. It really does not feel like a moderate resort. It feels very, very deluxe to me. If you walk straight back here, you can look over and they have this beautiful area down here. Lots of seating. There's a bar down there just directly underneath where we stood in the morning. You can get coffees and pastries and stuff. But just look at this. Look at these windows looking out over the lake. It really is something else and definitely does not feel moderate to me. The only reason I do think it's not a deluxe is because they only have uh buses. Yeah. So there there's only like one. And although Animal Kingdom Lodge is like that and that is that was the explanation that that me and my husband were given from one of the cast members that works here. That is the reason that this is not a deluxe and it just can't ever be. Animal Kingdom Lodge, I think, is the only exception. It's just so far out compared to everywhere else. It doesn't connect up to the Montreal or the boats, but it is still a deluxe. So, that is the one exception to that rule, but this feels like a deluxe. It really does. And because Coronado Springs is a convention resort, and it is a big convention resort as well, you do have all these little workstations over here. They've got lamps and charging ports, places to sit, cuz you will get a lot of people coming to this hotel who will be working. They're very well set up for that. And when we go downstairs, there is another area in the main part of the resort that also does have that. Yeah, maybe it's LL. The lifts are fancy here. So, they tell you which one to get in, which is C in this case. And then you don't press anything when you're inside. It just takes you That is fancy though, isn't it? That's very deluxe. It is. We've just been saying as we're going around these resorts, it's just never enough time on your trip. I would love to come here and just spend half a day at Coronado just walking around doing bits that I need to do, chilling, having a drink, just wandering basically, and then spend another half a day in another resort and another half a day in another resort. But there's just not enough days of your trip because you've got your park days and everything else that you're doing. I want to go to Disney Springs. We need to come for a whole month. It's the only way. Yeah. And I don't even think that would be enough. No, but it would be good. That would be better. This actually used to be the check-in desk for the regular part of Coronado Springs, as in all of the outlying buildings that we're going to see around there, the village, I believe they call it, rather than the tower. But now that all of the check-in has been moved across to Grandestino Tower, this has been made into just a really big chill and working area. So, you have these chairs around the side. There's some comfortable sofas and then over that side you can see there's some desk space with lamps again and power outlets and everything. Although this is a convention resort, it still feels very vacation-y and resorty. It's not as if it feels businessy. Does that make any sense? I don't know if I'm describing that very well. But if you did need to do some work and that's what you're here for, they have a lot of areas to do that. You can even take a little meeting behind here. They've got this big table. I have just sat down in this chair and it is everything. I don't know if you can tell how big it is, but when you sit down in it, you're practically laying down. This is so comfortable. This is the most comfortable chair I have sat in since I've been here. So, if ever you have overdone things, got bad back, you need to chill when you're at Disney World. Come to Coronado Springs, this chair. Look how beautiful the lobby is here as well. This is like the main lobby. They got Panchitos over there, which is a store. It's quite nice in there, actually. They got a lot of stuff. It's so nice out here. Look at this. There's a cool breeze. It's so beautiful out here. There's a cool breeze, which it's been quite hot today. So, this is perfect weather. Our destination. You can see across the water there. Three bridges. We're really hoping we can get a table. You can't actually book a table at Three Bridges. It's not somewhere where you can make an ADR ahead of time. You do just have to walk up. So, just allow yourself enough time. You might have to wait a little bit until you can get a table. But, it's beautiful when it's sunset around here. When we were here last year, it was just incredible. But yeah, just be aware you can't reserve it. And actually, when we came in in the Uber, I was a little bit concerned they might not let us in cuz we don't have an ADR, but I told him we were wanting to eat here and they did let us in, so it was fine. And there is Grandino Tower. Look how nice that is. We're seated and we've got this lovely view out across the water there. And last time we were here, if you remember, Cla and I sat at the bar and had a drink. And we loved the drink that Cla had, but we weren't so keen on mine. So, we're just watching back the vlog cuz we can't remember which was the good drink and which one we didn't prefer. Oh, we went to Roundup Rodeo that day. Oh, that was so good, wasn't it? That was good. Right. Okay, we're I'm around the area now. While CLA's doing that, I will just give you a look at the menu. So, they have the sangria flight, which is one of their signature things here. And there's various other sangrias that you can just get kind of separately. Specialty cocktails, wine, and they do have obviously what we're looking for, the non-alcoholic specialty beverages. So, we'll figure out which one it is that we want in a second. In terms of food, at the top here is dippable, spreadable, and sharable. There's a trio of dips. I may even have that just as like my meal. You can get regular chips and salsa, white queso, and charo dip. And they also have some chicken wings. Then for entre, you've got mahi mahi and shrimp, chicken mold, a tuna bowl, steak fruits. Cla says she's had that here before and it was really good. Then they've got a chicken berry salad, a tofu bowl, pork kitas tacos, and then three bridges signature pressed burger, which does sound good actually with smoked paprika fries. And you can see the sky there behind a Claire just looking so nice. It's not as fiery and orange as it was last time. We did have the most beautiful sunset, but it's still so nice out sat here. There's a cool breeze. This weather feels to me like March kind of weather. Just really, really nice. Not hot or anything. It's perfect. Our food has arrived. And the dip. I cannot wait to show you how large it is. It's a good job I got it as my entree. Cla got the steak. And you went for medium steak, did you? Yep. And with the I don't know how. Yeah, that's it on the side. So, I can add as much of that as I want. and paprika for fries. Was that I did have this before and it was just so good. Yeah, I feel like Paul would really love that. That would be right up his street. I have got the dips and it is very hard to convey just how big these dips are. Let me just move the actual chips. There's my phone. So there's Cla's phone is like the size of one of these dips. So I've got queso and another one and then another one. Yeah, we got queso and the corn dip. Yeah, that's the coin and an entire thing of these chips. So, and that's like an a starter. This Yeah, this would I mean this would be like uh for four people you could share this for four. Obviously, I'm not eating anything else other than this, but I am still going to struggle to eat this. Like, that is the biggest amount of gu like what is going on? I think this is going to be good. It looks amazing. That corn dip looks so good. In the end, we looked back in my photos and we did actually find photos of the drinks. However, we couldn't figure out who's, so it didn't help us. In the end, we both went for the hibiscus. But that's cuz we did ask the guy which one was the sweetest, and he said the hibiscus because the one that you had last year, you didn't think was particularly sweet. No. Whereas mine was. So, we're hoping we've gone for the right one. Right. We've got a straw now, and we're going to We've just stirred up the drink. It's quite nice. Is it what you had last time? I think so. It is nice. Oh, yeah. I do like it. And I think we picked the right one. Oh, that steak looks good. How is it so far? Is it cooked to temperature? It looks amazing. I'm about to try. You look happy. I've just had a movie quote into my head again. You know how that goes for me. Little things happen and a movie quote will shoot into my head. Or friend or or a friend. I mean, it very often is a friend's quote. I've just had Matthew McConnA when he's like so perfectly pink. Do you remember that bit? I haven't watched it, I don't think, but I can imagine him in like a squeaky voice. He was saying it was funny. Right, let's try this guac. For some reason, I feel more overwhelmed by the guac than the rest of it cuz it just looks like a lot. So, let's see. I feel like could have spicy stuff on it, Dora. That actually the stuff on top tastes more like seasoning than spicy. Okay. So, I don't know that it is just chili. It's just a sprinkle. I think it's just like a sprinkle. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now I'm trying the queso. And I love the chips and queso at San and Helen, which is where we're going tomorrow. So, it's going to be a double chips and queso situation today and tomorrow. Not sorry. That is good. That's so good. Let's try the corn one. And I have been accused in the past of not putting enough dip on my tortilla chips. Someone has actually told me that I don't. So, I am putting quite a lot on just for those of you who are worried that I might not be getting the full flavor. Oh, they are they are all good. I think that one's my favorite. Yeah, the the queso is really good. The corn the corn has like a a bit of a lemony taste. Um there's some cheese on top of it as well. Just very like savory yummness. They're all amazing. This might be the best trio of dips I've ever had. It's very, very good. Very, very good. But it is extremely sharable. If you are going to attempt to eat this yourself, it would very much be your entire dinner. I think you could come here and get these dips and the sangria flight if you were just wanting to have like so not necessarily like a full on meal, but if you were wanting to come for more a snack or you're just a little bit hungry, this and the sangria flies would probably be great to share between two of you. But that steak is cooked perfectly. It does look as if it is actually. Yeah. And the ch I mean the fries are also very tasty. They've got a seasoning on what what was the seasoning? Can you remember? Paprika. And I've also just realized while you're talking about your steak, people are going to be able to hear me crunching my trio of dips. I've got microphone on so I apologize about that. Just arriving here at the Magic Kingdom and the fireworks are happening. So the first Starlight parade would have happened. Now it's fireworks and then we're going to be catching the second parade. So, a lot of people will probably be leaving now if they saw the first parade. So, hopefully we will be able to get some kind of good spot. We are a little bit later than we planned, so we are going to kind of have to take what we can get in terms of parade spot, but I'm sure we'll be able to find somewhere where we can see properly. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] We've managed to get a pretty good spot. So, you can see the Main Street Confectionary over there. Then we've got the train station over to the left. So, we're right here on the corner. It is very busy with people leaving after the fireworks. I'm so excited to see this parade. I've been looking forward to this all day. [Music] Good evening, dear friends. Come with me on a magical journey hissed by starlight. [Music] By virtue of starlight and all that is good, may each and every one of your dreams come true. Wow. One wish to make all of this. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. [Music] [Music] Music is my language and you will Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Applause] Wherever your heart, I will. [Music] [Music] That's all they need. Well, that invited us dust. That's right. And maybe they'll be able to fight, too. [Music] [Music] There's so many stars to wish upon tonight. Come on, everybody. We wish a star. Look at all our pals. Oh, Mickey, there's been a star. Just like us. The parade is over and oh my goodness, it was so good. It was It was really good. It was really good. We'll let you know what we thought about it and everything in a minute. We are in line at the Colonel Kitchen because haven't had any popcorn yet this trip that needs to be remedied right now. They have blue popcorn for the Starlight Parade, I believe. Oh, is that what it is? It's like a special mix that they do. Yeah. I always find the candied popcorn like too sweet, though. So, I like butter and then the things on top and at push kettle corn if they don't have butter, but then that is still sweet. Got the goods. Now, time to go and find CLA. And then we're going to grab a Starbucks. I think we like to just let the crowds get to the bus stop first and then we wait till it's a bit quieter and then go for the bus cuz it's a bit crazy otherwise. I love the detail around here that you can hear the piano lessons going on up there. If it doesn't get in a minute, I will record it. I just missed it then. You can hear it now. It's always worth actually coming up here and just listening to it cuz I love it. CLA was saying she just hadn't noticed it. Yeah, you can hear piano playing and singing and stuff which is a music teaching school up there. Quite sweet actually. It is. Yeah, I love it. This is like deja vu. Yeah. From last week for you guys or yesterday for us. We have obviously just watched the Starlight Parade and we thought we would end this vlog here but just say what we thought about that. Yeah, I thought it was lovely actually. I loved it. Yeah, it's not it's not like that long so that's kind of good. I guess especially if it's the later one if you want to go you I mean cuz it is what time is it half 10 it's on at half 10 and it must have lasted like 10 15 minutes so you can then still get out at reasonable time obviously you'd potentially have the cues of the um buses of the buses which is why we've waited yeah but not quite as bad as what it would have been after the fireworks after the fireworks I think the cues for the buses would have been horrendous whereas after the parade it wouldn't have been nowhere near as badm No, a lot of people did leave though, so we've hung back. I always do this. It's just too If you go to the buses, you'll get in a queue and you might have to wait for like two or three. Annoyed. Yeah. This is way better to sit here and like have a drink, have a drink, chill, have a chat, listen to the piano player. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, the actual parade itself was Yeah, it was just really quite pretty. It was It was beautiful. Like the colors on I was really looking forward to the train, which is the last bit. Oh, you knew that already, did you? Yeah, I had seen that and I was really looking forward. I knew it would last and it did not disappoint cuz you've obviously got the face on the front and then it's just kind of like going along and then it bursts into color. It's huge. Yeah, it's massive. Um, so I loved it. I'm so glad we got to see that. And we were a bit worried we were not going to have enough time to find a good spot, but we walked in and I literally just took position in a little space that I saw. Yeah. And also the thing that actually ended up being quite good is that everyone that was sat down like waiting for the parade um generally everyone stay sat. So then all of those people could see and then the people behind that was standing up then they could all see. So you almost had two layers of people then that could completely see. Yeah. Whereas I most normal parades and things you got like it's only the first row who can see properly. Yeah. So that was kind of good actually cuz I was stood up behind you and I could see. Yeah. I stayed sitting down and then obviously people aren't then holding phones up and blocking the view. So it was perfect. There were definitely less people watching the second one. Someone told me the other day they watched the 8:30 one and it was super busy. I mean it was quite busy. It was quite busy still. Um but it wasn't too crazy. So I would recommend if you can stay up later to watch the second one. And I would recommend that always whether it's the Halloween party or the Starlight one. the later one will always be quieter because a lot of people with young children will have gone home or if they've been here all day and all that sort of thing. But yeah, we love it and we're going to take a slow walk out of here now, head to the bus. It looks quite quiet now on Main Street. I can see it's midnight. It is midnight. It's another late night for us. It was goodness knows what time last night. So yeah, two late nights in a row. Tomorrow we're going to be going to Epcot's and we don't have to be there super early. So, we want to like get up and go, but we haven't got anything till like midday that's a commitment. So, we've got our Guardians return time and then you're doing a live live stream for Patreon. Yes. For my Patreon members and then San Helen. Yes. Which I love. And are we going to watch the fireworks? Yeah, I think we'll probably try to do that tomorrow. Um I think that is going to be our last time in Epcot on this trip. Yeah. A Yeah. So, we will try and do the fireworks tomorrow night. And there's some other little snacks we wanted to look at around the World Showcase. And we were hoping to have something from the caramel store in Germany. Yeah, that would be good. And also, we didn't really do anything up near the front because we came in through like by France, didn't we? You want to do so in You spoke to Becky, didn't you? And Becky said that today in Epcot was just crazy busy. They just went back to the hotel cuz it was so crazy. So hopefully tomorrow will be a little bit better for us. We'll have to see. At least we've got Guardians booked. We have and our dinner. So, at least we can eat and ride Guardian. They're getting very excited in the music room. Maybe someone's being a bit, you know, badly behaved during their lesson. So, yeah, that's tomorrow, which will be next week for you guys. And we've still got more to come. We've still got Hollywood Studios we haven't even done yet. Claire is honestly This is the time of night when it's midnight. So, this is why we're wrapping up now because by the time we get back to the room, we will basically be expired and not even able to speak. So, we hope you guys enjoyed this one. It was a bit more of a relaxed vlog, obviously going around the resorts, but I feel like that sometimes is nice to show something a little bit different and I know you guys love going around the resorts. So, I hope you did enjoy it. Like I said earlier, please do let us know in the comments if there are certain resorts that you want to see. We will try to go to the ones that you really want to look at. So, please do let us know. And don't forget to give it a thumbs up as well. That helps when other people are looking for Disney vlogs for them to find it. And just a huge thank you to everyone who came up today to say hello. We met loads of you, didn't we, when we were going around the resorts. and a few people here in the Magic Kingdom as well this evening. And we just love it. We love chatting to you. So, always do come and say hello. And just thank you to all of you for watching and commenting, subscribing, following on Instagram, supporting on Patreon, all of those things. If you are interested in that, I'll link it below. I do always do live streams when I'm here as well as at home. I do them like monthly. We just have a good chat and catch up and everything. So, um I will put that below if you're interested in that. But a huge thank you for taking the time out of your day to watch. We are going back to the hotel to bed. I can't wait. I'm very excited to get to sleep and we will see you next Saturday for more Epcot. Bye. [Music] Guess what song we got? We got Disco. So good. Cuz you can start dancing like immediately, can't you? You're still flying backwards and dancing. [Music]"

      "transcript": "Hello pixies. Today we are getting ready to prep and pack for the most magical but also simultaneously the most difficult time to pack for Disney World. So we are getting ready to head there for the month of November. We are doing Christmas at Disney. I'm so excited. We're doing Mickey's Very Mary. We've got Jollywood Nights. We're doing time at each of the four theme parks. We may even be park popping into the water parks for some time there if weather permits. We'll see. Again, the most difficult time to pack for. We're going to get into a lot of that, but if you are excited, also prepping for a trip, you got a countdown going, you're looking forward to it, go ahead, click that thumbs up button, and let's jump into it. So, we're about 30 days out from our Christmas trip to Disney World, and I am so excited. Obviously, here on the channel, if you're part of the fam, you know we love Disney. If you're new, welcome to Pixie Dusted Mom. Happy to have you. Love it if you join the fam. But we absolutely love it. I think it is probably it is tied for springtime. But as far as magical times, I honestly I think Christmas has to win hands down for the most magical time at the most magical place on earth. And it is gorgeous. Everything is decked out and I can't wait to go back. I can't wait to see it and experience it. I am a Christmas girly through and through. It is October and half of my house is already decorated for Christmas. So, needless to say, I really really like Christmas. It has been a a staple. Like, my husband and I met at Christmas. And there's there's a lot of things that go into the fact that I just I love Christmas. But, here we are. We're going to go ahead start jumping into it. Let me get another sip of my peppermint mocha, which I'm probably overcaffeinated, so we're going to be talking really fast here. Cheers, by the way. But for as much as I love Disney at Christmas, it's also a really difficult time of year because the weather can be all over the board. We have had days where it would be in the low 60s. And while I know 60s is kind of sometimes comfortable, when you've got that water coming off the bree or the breeze coming off the water, the water's coming off the breeze. That's not physically possible. But when the water the breeze is coming off the water, we'll get it right here in a second. But when that is happening, it is chilly. Especially at Epcot, if you've ever been there, like that is one of the worst. Magic Kingdom can get a little chilly, too. I mean, Animal Kingdom's always hot and you're usually not that late, but seriously, the weather can be so cool. And then we've also had times where it was 95° and the weather had said it was going to be something else and we were sweating. Like, I needed a fan for my armpits. It was so bad, you guys. Like, it was rough. But that is why we're talking about it now. And while yes, it is 30 days out from the trip, we are going to go ahead and start kind of perusing the weather. And we're also going to talk about packing in layers. That way, no matter what comes, whether you're boiling, you're melting, you are freezing, and you're popsicle, whatever that looks like, you're going to be prepared and ready to go for Christmas and the holiday season at Disney World. So, I have all of my handy dandy packing list. We're going to go through check the weather and then we're going to start working on things that we can get packed now. Things that we can do for putting together outfits. I know the outfit is not that important. It is not. It's going to honestly it's not going to make or break your Disney trip, but it's fun to feel cute. It's fun. And I feel like Disney is one of these places where you can dress so fun and so cute and so out there and like be themed and all this stuff and like bounding as your favorite character or your kids can wear fullon costumes and it's not judged like we're the family. I'm like when they get older they probably won't be doing this so I'm just going to let them enjoy it. We've taken Buzz Lighter to Costco you guys. Okay. And people think, \"Oh, you get half of a group that thinks it's cute and then the other half's like, why is your child in a costume? It's not Halloween.\" Like, cuz they're a kid and they get to enjoy it. But at Disney World, nobody bats an eye. It's just like, \"Oh my gosh, look at the little Buzz Lightyear or look at the princess.\" And it's like so fun. And even as a grown-up, like you can do it and like relive that inner childhood feeling. And like I'm dressed like Pooh Bear right now and I love Pooh Bear. I don't care if I'm 33. Nobody's really judging you for that there and you just get to have fun. So, it's it's it's really this magical place where you can do that. Now, if you want to wear your own clothes, there's no judgment in that. But, I do suggest you go ahead and start kind of pre-planning, packing, and also still taking into consideration all of these layers and all the things that we're going to talk about in the video. You don't have to be like trying to go all out for it to need to prep and do some things in advance. So, this is going to be helpful no matter what style of packing that you do. But, let's go ahead and check the weather. I'm going to go ahead and pop it up here on the screen. So, looking at the November weather for Orlando, you can do this for December. Any month that you're going, you can kind of look this up and kind of get an idea of what it could be like. Um, constantly kind of I would check that once a week or so. And especially leading up to the days before your trip, I would kind of monitor it every few days. It's accur.com, but I'll pop that up here so you can see some days we're looking like the very first day of November is 84° with a low of 67° F. And then we've got days that are some of them are 75° and then it's 60° overnight. So, you're just kind of varying between. And even on Thanksgiving Day, so the 27th, it's going to get as low as 71° with a 59°. The night before or the day before it'll be as high as 79, but then it could drop as low as 56. And I can tell you those temperatures that around 60° can be so cold. I cannot tell you how many times we have been in line for the Skyline or we've been walking around Epcot and I'm like, I'm chilly. and even be talking with other guests that they're like, \"We're from Michigan or we're from this place.\" And we're like, \"This is cold for us.\" Like 60° at home is like a heat wave, but they're literally standing there shivering and they're like, \"I wish I would have brought my jacket. I wasn't I didn't think it this would be cold.\" And so if you're someone like that, if you're someone that does get chilly, if you've got like if you take medications that maybe blood thinners, anything like that that makes you cold, definitely prepare for that because it can be cold. Like I have people in our family that they do and we just have to be like, you may want to take something like that. I know when we went like my grandmother was freezing and it was November and then we've also been and it would be December and we would be like melting away. But like I said, check your weather and kind of get an idea of what your temperatures are going to be looking at. For me, anything between 70 and 80°. Again, I'm packing layers. So, we're going to start going through that. I'll be sharing some of the things that I'm packing and kind of getting prepared for. Another thing I'm going to is I've got my packing list all printed out. On the right side of it, I have an outfit planner. This is one I create. I have them in my Etsy shop or if you have my Pixie dusted memories guide, you get every single packing list I'm about to mention. Um, the only ones available in the shop are the packing list themselves. But beyond that, all the planning lessons and all the planning sheets and all that stuff come included with that. So, I've got one for myself. I've got one for each of my girls. I have a hubby's packing list. I've got my printable for our Lightning Lane prep day, um, grocery cheat sheets, all that good stuff, and then also our wish list, and then loads more planners that I'm going to be working with later on when we're getting ready for our Lightning Lane Day, which I'm so excited about. Like, I think it's so fun planning that stuff out. Especially once you start getting to that 60-day mark and you're booking dining and then when you're getting closer to that 7-day mark and you're buying lightning lanes and like all these things, it's like the trip is coming together and it's like really happening and it's so exciting. So, I'm going to go ahead. I've got some things here from Amazon. I want to do a quick little haul. We're going to jump into some of the other things. I have other stuff that I need to put away from our past trip and I'm like, I think I'm going to need some of that. So, I'm going to start laying things out on the bed. Always for me, my guest bedroom is ground zero for packing. It can be your office. It could be like sometimes it's the wall. When we would live with family and we didn't have a guest bedroom, it was like all piled on the wall along the side of our bed. And it's like I'm sorry, it's a mess for a few days or a few weeks depending on how early we started prepping. But like it's just it is what it is. But if you are needing to go ahead and grab some stuff, have a suitcase, start throwing things in it, and then you can kind of unpack it and start laying things out and kind of prepping. I love to make sure I lay eyes on everything as I'm packing it. So, we'll lay it out, lay our eyes on it, and then start packing it away. Um, another great way is if you have an under the bed tote, anything like that, you can like throw little things into. Um, you can also do where you can throw it in your closet. Lots of ideas. But if your trip is coming up where I'm going to need you to pause the video, go grab your stuff and let's start laying it out together. Let's start laying eyes on it. Start prepping. And if you've not got started, we we should get started. And and you you need to get started. Don't procrastinate. This whole packing the night before, that's stressful. Don't do that. All right. So, some of the things I've already started grabbing for our trip are these cute little night gowns. I think they're adorable. They're also got the little hymn on it. I'm a girl mom, but I will also link some Christmas pajamas that are great for little guys, too. Little princes. I have princesses and they want princess stuff to the nth degree. Like ruffles on everything. Um, but I went ahead and grabbed these. They're great. We can wear them again for Christmas season. Like, they can do all kinds of stuff with these. They love them. They'll I don't care if it's July, they'll pull out and want to wear their Christmas pajamas. And they're also really nice cuz I love that it's a night gown. So even no matter how warm it is, they're going to be pretty comfortable in this. Um, grab this dress which is so cute. The girls actually helped me pick these out. This is what they're going to wear for Mickey's Very Mary. So it looks kind of like a little Christmas tree and it's got ornaments all over it. I freaking love it. And it's got little jingle bells on it, which is so cute. So I've got the red one. I think Lucy picked that out. And then let me see the or no, Lucy or Bella's is the red one. And then Lucy wanted the green one. So it looks like an actual Christmas tree. So that's their very merry outfits. Um for Jollywood, grab this. These are so inexpensive, too. They're super cute. Love that kind of glam style is what we're going for. It's fun. We're dressing up, but also I'm probably going to have them take their Christmas photos in these. I'm not going to lie, these are cute. So, I think we're going to be just fine. We'll do Christmas photos in them, too. Kills two bird with one stone. And then got this one for Lucy for her little Jollywood. So, it's like a little adjustable strap on this side, ruffle one shoulder on this side, and it's got the stars on it. She loved this dress. I think it's fun. Sometimes I love picking them out and like surprising them. So some of the stuff is surprises and then some of the pieces I got to sit down and like look at them with them and look at the dresses and that kind of stuff. And so it's it's fun as they get older. Used to I would surprise them with the princess dresses, but now it's nice for them to like sit down and get to pick it out. and we'll be like talking about, okay, we're going to go to this park and like Moana's there or Anna Elsa is there or this princess is there or this is there and they like dressing like the person they're going to go see and like their favorite princess and they're like I want to dress in this and so it's really fun getting to like talk to them and plan that with them cuz they are little planners like their mommy and I'm so excited. I love getting to do that with them. It's like I have my own baby dolls. Like I loved baby dolls and like dressing them up and doing all that stuff as a kid and it's like I'm living the dream. Like 8-year-old me would think I have so arrived right now. And so I love it. Super fun. Got these little headband bows for the girls. A lot of this stuff I got during Prime Days in October, which is great. I think I shared most of this during the Prime Days sale. This little bow. This could be great all year round. Like if you're doing a Snow White dress, you could throw this on with a Snow White dress. It's actually a women's size. It's super comfortable, too, which is nice. It's like a little bow. It's like you're a present. Um, but it it's super comfortable. Like, I feel like I could wear this. Like, it's not binding. It feels secure, but it doesn't feel like it's so tight that it's going to like give me a headache. Cuz anymore ears give me a headache. That's where I'm at. Um, I'm going to have them wear those with their Christmas dresses. And then I got this one. Thought it was really cute. I don't know. This trend may be over, but I'm like, I think it's cute. So, I'm going to get it. I don't care. But it is a little knotted headband and it's all like bejeweled and whatnot. I've got a red dress. Yes, a red athletic style dress that I'm going to wear for this one. So, we can talk outfits in a bit, but got those. We've already busted into these with their lollipops. I like these. They're good. They have some vitamin C in them. I'm not like taking them as having the kids take them as if it's really going to up their vitamin C, but I don't know. They have less sugar. It's got two pops, has 8 g of sugar combined. So, 4 g of sugar in a pop, which is not bad. These are great. These are great entertainment. I'm not above bribing with a lollipop or stickers or Smarties. Sometimes you got to do what you got to do. Okay, you can like be very intentional with your parenting at home, but sometimes it's like I just want to hit the easy button. We're hitting the easy button. And then kind of last thing that I got that was in this box. I felt like I had more than this. Oh, I do. I have a couple of other things that I've had for a little bit I need to share. But I can get this open. Okay, I'm just going to show you the box. I can't get it open. But it is these little build your own snowman. And it comes with a moldable foam putty, two eyes, two arms, and one carrot nose, and one smile for each set. And it's a three-pack. So, if you have three kids, you could do this. If you're doing stocking stuffers, this would also be kind of a fun little stocking stuffer. Jolly basket, anything like that that you might be doing. These are fun. And I think they're gonna enjoy making their little snowman. So, I'm going to surprise them with those in their um where does this need to go? In their activity bag backpack that we're going to take. And then, hold on. A couple of other little activities that I have are some little Disney Christmas coloring books. So, we've got these. I just went ahead and grabbed some from Amazon cuz it comes in a bundle and by the time you get the bundle, it's just as cheap as going to the dollar store nowadays. So there you go. Got another one. This one has Minnie Mouse and Figaro. So that'll probably be Bella's. And then they also had this princess one. And it comes with its own crayons, but it's like all these activities and stickers and little things that you can do. So super cute with that. Um, grab these. I had them last year. They were such a big hit. So we're grabbing them again. But they're little ornaments and they have they can actually go on a tree if you wanted to like decorate a tree. It comes with those. They've got little stickers to decorate each one and also have a whole bunch of strings in there that you can use and decorate and like make little activities. I think these are fun, especially if you're doing usually doing like the sticker sheets. These are great instead. Got these guys to go on our resort window. It's a whole collection of Mickey and Minnie and then little window clings. Really inexpensive. You can throw those up. It's got snowflakes. You could use these again. Like you could reuse them when you come home. Stick them on your slider if you like. For us, we have a playroom window and so it might put them in our playroom window, the kids windows, whatever. And it makes it super cute and fun and festive and it's a really neat way to like decorate your window. Especially if you are staying at either a value or a moderate resort. Those just they have their own magic because of having the windows. It's not a big building like with deluxe resorts. It's I don't know. It just doesn't feel like it happens there, but it's just a special kind of magic that if you're staying at a value or a moderate, you get that. And it's so cute to walk around and see other people's window displays. It's adorable. I've got a signing board. I'm so excited. We do one of these every trip. Usually, they look like this for the girls, and they're each individual. It's them dressed up as a character, but this time I had her do a family signing board and I'm so excited about it. Looks like this. I think this is a 12. Yes, it's a 12 by 12. So cute. And it is themed towards a statue and stockings and everything that Dean and I got when we very first went to Disney on our honeymoon. So for the first few years that we started going to Disney, they had this collection and it was this kind of burgundy cream and ivory and it was just it was beautiful. We loved it. And so that was like our souvenir is every few trips it was like one year or one trip one year we got this tree skirt and then the next year when we went back our souvenir was the stockings and then another year when we went back our souvenir was the statue and it was like I don't know those are so special to us and I did like I decorated our whole room. So if you want to go see that it's over on spoonful. It's a it's fun. Um, but it was so special because it meant something to us and like we really like that and it was adding to our Christmas collection. We met at Christmas and it was just it it's really part of our story which is so fun and it was a lot. Like we saved so much money. That was like our only souvenir at that time that we would get is we would pick like one piece to add to our holiday collection each year. And so those are so special. And so I'm so excited. Like I don't know why I'm almost getting teared up over this. Um but this is going to be fun and it'll be a neat thing to add to that collection cuz obviously they don't sell it anymore. 2012 was a long time ago. But um I'm excited to get them to sign this and then we can frame it and hang it up in our room. And so I think that'll be cute. And then she also made us this really fun little snow globe that looks exactly the same. So I need to get that out and put it up in our room now that our decorations are up. But that's a few of the things that I've got started. So, I want to go ahead start laying out our outfits and getting things like that prepped and packed because the clothes takes up the most room. It's the biggest bulk of anything and everything. So, I always love to start there cuz after that it's all downhill. So, let's go ahead. I'm going to start gathering some things, making a big pile of clothes on this bed, and then we'll start dividing it out, prepping our packing cubes, doing future us a favor, which is my favorite thing to do when on vacation, and start getting some things in the suitcase. [Music] Oh yeah. Oh [Music] yeah. [Music] Oh [Music] yeah. Oh, [Music] this is also your reminder if you kept anything from last Christmas, last holiday season, and you're like, \"Hm, I wonder if that still fits them.\" Go look, go check. I know I kept things back for the girls from last year, and we're going to see if anything still fits. uh or if anything can be passed down or if we just need to pass it along to someone else and if it's too little for our girls. I have this this is only little ones. It's old. Um back when it was actually easy to get Only Little One stuff. Um but we got this for Lucy. It's a size three. I don't know. I think it's going to be too small. for Bella. Sadly, um she is getting to be a pretty hardcore four size, so I don't know that that's going to work. [Music] See what's in this box. [Applause] Nothing. Could have swore I had something. me down pajamas, sweatshirts, but I don't don't want to take a lot of sweatshirts. You know what I mean? I will grab her Minnie Mouse jacket. Lucy has a Mickey one just like this from a previous trip, but I bought oversized. So, that's one of the things with this one. I think I bought Lucy like a medium. I think it was We got this a year ago, I feel like. And so it right now it's starting to almost perfectly fit Bella, but when I bought it, it was like a size too big. I'm like, we can roll the sleeves up a little bit. It can be oversized. Oversized is cute. But because it was like a $45 hoodie, like it's I just kind of want it to last, you know? I know we had a Christmas dress. I found it. Okay. And I think they actually still sell these, so I can link it for you guys if you're like, \"Oh my gosh, that's so cute. So, yeah, it's a 34. She's a four. I think this should fit. I'm going to have him try it on first to make sure. There's a little bit of staining cuz, you know, kids wore this, but it's not bad. It's not noticeable enough that it's like, wow, that's really stained. So, we're going to go with it. So, these pieces I'm going in and adding to the days. Like, obviously, we have our Jollywood outfits. We've got our Very Mary. Um, we have travel day outfits already set. I picked up these little metallic skirts at Walmart for I think they were like six bucks or something. It was I feel like it was really inexpensive. And so, got those that they can wear. I just need to get some sort of top to go with that. Um, so we've got a few new pieces. is got these little dresses I think or maybe those were $8 and I think the dresses was like were like $6. It's a lightweight kind of cottony style dress, long sleeves and it does have little pockets, but they can wear these with some little bike shorts and it kind of wears both with the warm but then it also goes into cooler if it starts getting breezy. These I'm going to add for another day that we can have. These are like their main outfits for our fun times. And then we're also we can go in and grab some clothes for like playtime wearing to the pool if we're hanging around at the resort doing that sort of thing that we're not like going to Disney Springs or going to play mini golf or those things or doing the parties. Then we can have like filler clothes to do that and we're not buying entirely new outfits for everything. And of course in true mom fashion I'm just now laying out my outfits. I've thought of them. I've thought of some ideas. So, this is kind of what I've got for Mickey's Very Mary. I can do an out I want to do an outfit video where I like try it on and like show like actual stuff. But, this is it. I'll have to use like my sticky bra probably. But, it's got adjustable straps. I hate that it's not padded, but it does have the shorts in it. Kind of has that tulish skirt. And I will say it's less bright Christmas red. like it's looking like that on the screen, but in person it's more of a deeper berry red than like full-blown Christmas red. This is Christmas red for comparison. So, if you see this on screen, then you know it's Christmas red. If you see this, it's berry. I don't know why my camera is throwing those colors, but for some reason it is. And then I've got this dress that I snagged and I'm like, these things I can wear for the holiday season at home and stuff, but I got this dress. It's like a little It can go off the shoulder just a little bit or you can pull it up and make it like a tank top dress. But super cute. Kind of got the slouchy neckline. It also It's a little bit longer, but it's not I'm 5'3. I don't want anything super long. It hits me at my ankle. See, just made my ankle. So, I can still wear my tennis shoes. And the best part of all, it has pockets. I'm so excited. So, that's that's kind of my my jollywood. It's not as fancy, but I'm like it it look once I put it on, it looks fancier. We'll put it that way. But, it's very lightweight, very jersey, very comfy, so I can still like chase kids through a theme park. Um, got this shirt here. Kind of a pleated tank. So, I'm thinking I can wear this with some leggings. And again, it's just a green tank. So, like I can wear this all over again. I can wear it all Christmas season. Like, if you work a 9 to5 and you kind of have to have a business casual, you could totally throw this on with some slacks and you could wear it all over again. Just wear it to work. Throw a blazer on over it, whatever. It's got options. So, I like that. And then I've got this green set which I've wore before in like I think I wore it on our most Yeah, I wore it on Dean and I's most recent trip, but it's pants. They're so comfy. Like this set should not be as comfortable as it is. I don't know why, but it is like the breeziest, most comfortable thing. Even September in Disney, this was great. It's got pockets. It's nice. It's comfy. And then if it gets cool, I can throw a sweatshirt on with it, a um hoodie, cardigan, whatever. Like I could literally throw this cardigan I'm wearing on with it. Like I could throw it over it cuz it's got some green stripes in it. That would be perfect. So got that set. Um and of course I got to figure out what Dean's wearing cuz I'm I'm one of these ladies I pack for my husband. If you're new around here, the man wore nothing but plaid on our honeymoon and somehow he magically got out of it. He just was like, I like this and I like this and I like this. And he just packed everything he liked. And that's great. I'm really happy. He was so thrilled with every selection that went into his suitcase. But when it come time to put outfits together and like actually walk out the door, thank god we had a washer and dryer inside of our room. If you wonder why I'm like, \"Oh, and now I'm like actually I'm putting two and two together.\" I think that's why I like having the ability to do laundry on vacation. He scarred me. Because yeah, that man genuinely if he had put together an outfit of the most of the plaid would have been plaid shirt, plaid shorts, plaid boxers, plaid shoes, shoes, the shoes were plaid, too, guys. The socks, everything. So, in honor of that, we probably should find him some plaid to wear for Christmas, but not all plaid. You know what I mean? Unless I find a plaid suit. That might be a little much for a theme park. Okay, let's keep going. The nice part, too, about prepping in advance, it gives you time to do stuff like this, laundry. That way, if you've got clothes, you're packing your own, you're mixing in, you want to wash the new clothes, like whatever category and bucket you will fall into, it's nice to have time to do this and not feel so rushed. Cuz I can tell you the times that I have time to plan in advance and I make it a priority and I'm like, I am going to set future me up for success, I feel so much better, so much more relaxed going into the vacation. And it just something about the prepping helps lower the stress. Especially type A. I'm like I am a perfectionist. Like I want it to be done right. I overthink everything. So I'm like I want to have time to like mellow out and be ready to be in vacation mode. So doing stuff like this really helps you. [Music] [Music] Another thing that is really great to start prepping now is your packing gear. Check it out. Pull out the suitcase. Make sure it doesn't have tags from the last time you flew on it. Go ahead, throw those in the garbage if you haven't already. Get your luggage tags together. Know what size? Maybe double check. You may have booked your flights literally months ago. So, who knows like, did I buy bags? Do my flights come with bags? Which bags do I get? What size do I get? Can I take them on the plane? Do they need to be checked in the belly of the plane? Like, know those things in advance. Weight limits. What are we looking at? What are we up against here? And it really helps you kind of finetune that. Those of you that drive, like the world's your oyster, which is amazing cuz you can pack anything and everything you want, but then it's also like you end up packing excessively. Like it's just too much. For us personally, we've gotten it down to where we typically need two checked bags for our family of four. And that is for myself, my husband, and my two little girls at six and four years old. And then we all have personal items. Typically, more times than not anymore, we fly Spirit. They've been the best price point for us flying out of Nashville here at BNA. And so they've given us the most affordability, honestly, even with adding bags and things like that that we might have to pay for. Yeah, it just it ends up being cheaper. With all those details in mind, after checking your flights, it makes it really easy for you to narrow down, okay, we can take this bag, this bag, and you can start working towards the goal of getting it into it, knowing if you need to purchase extra bags to take the things that you want to take. In my mind, there's really no such thing as overpacking if you use everything. So, you can pack as minimally or as over the top as you want. I know some people, they will take a full outfit, a purse, ears, different shoes for every single outfit. But to me, I'm like, you know what? You do you, baby. Cuz if that is what makes you happy and you're going to use it and you're going to wear everything, I don't think that's overpacking. When it comes down to overpacking, ultimately for me, how I see that is if you're taking a bunch of stuff that you're not using, you're not needing, and it's more than just like, okay, we took one sweater per person and we ended up we it was fine, we were good. But if you've got 16 outfits and you wear seven of them, that's overpacking. So, but doing things like laying your clothes out, planning per day of knowing, okay, this day we're going to Magic Kingdom, this day we're doing the Very Merry Party, this day we're doing Jollywood, this day we're doing Disney Springs. And kind of knowing those things and looking at your itinerary instead of just packing and looking at some random packing list that says take seven shirts and 14 shorts and like all these different things and then you end up and you're like, what the heck am I even wearing? You're having to make all these decisions for you and your family. My final point of the prepare TED talk is literally doing future you a favor because a lot of times we're trying to get ready. We're trying to get the kids ready. Hubby's asking us questions. What are we doing? What are we seeing? You're trying to talk through the day and kind of prepare your kids and set them up for success and you're doing all the things that everybody on your social feed has told you to do and you are over stimulated, overwhelmed and it doesn't feel anything like a vacation. So things that you can do of eliminating decisions like what am I going to wear? What am I going to do this? How is this going to look? How is that going to be? If you can kind of pre-plan that and know, okay, these are our points of time that we're trying to hit. This is what we're going to do. This is what we're going to wear. And you've kind of done, like I say, done future you a favor. It really takes a lot of that off. And it helps Disney honestly feel like an actual vacation. It's a little more like, okay, we're doing something. We're making things happen. and we're checking off a list. Like, you may have all of that still. It may be a little bit of a hustle, a little bit of a go, but it's relaxing all at the same time. One of the last few things that I want to prep and kind of get started today are the girls travel day backpacks. They're going to be using these as their personal items. And we're going to put their activities in here. I'm going to have their snacks, their travel blankets, all that good stuff. This is one of those ways that I usually over buy for. And so I want to go ahead and start laying eyes on it now so that I can make sure. I do want to take some kind of back stock. This is just for travel day. So I don't want to have too many things in there that there's just a lot and they can go through a whole pack of sticker sheets. Like we're not doing that. We'll probably put two or three per child in there in their backpacks. Have those ready. I need to work on their tablets. Um they've still have the original like SD cards in there and they're like running out of space and so we need to get new ones and like do some updating. I need I'll put their yodos, other things in there. These are just some of those little random things that they're really good to have as far as activities go. And I'm also going to have backtock of these. So, what I don't put in here and use, I'm going to have them in a little pack. I'll probably either get like a little zippy bag or a packing cube or something and put some of these pieces in there as like backtock for using at restaurants or while we're waiting and those types of things. You've also got to consider the flight home, too. So, you may want to have like a little Ziploc bag of like, okay, these are our return flight things. Like, obviously your tablet's kind of reusable both ways, but sticker sheets and things like that. Anything that's kind of more one-time use style things, you may want to have another set of those. So, for these, they're they're simple modern backpacks. They've had these ever since they were like toddler age, and like we're definitely out of the toddler age, but they still work great. I will um pop the link for these in the description box and what size they are cuz I know it's like hard to know sizing. They've been able to use these since they were about I think I've I think Bella's used hers as little as like 2 and 1/2 and so it it's been a good like toddler size backpack for her. Um but these are fun. I'm going to go ahead open up those snowmen that I couldn't get into the box. I actually brought my handy dandy scissors this time. But it's a whole kit. Comes in a little tub like so. So that's going to be hers. I'm going to go ahead and remove the plastic wrapper. Sorry, that's annoying. But I'm going to go ahead and remove that. Let's see. The rest of this I do have to open when it's time. But any extra any excess like trash and plastic and things that I don't have to have in here, I'm going to go ahead and remove that. I'm going to stick it in the front pocket. She has hair clips in here or hair combs in here. Wondered where those went. I have the other one in the front of Bella's backpack. And then let's see. Go in. I have some cute little sticker sheets. These are a little bit bigger and they are to make gingerbread houses. So, I thought these were cute. These are great like any like you could use these going on a trip. You could use these on a regular trip. It doesn't have to be a Disney trip. Just be a holiday Christmas trip in general. Going to see family. Um, you could have these as an activity for Christmas. If you're hosting or something, I can use the rest of these when we're hosting our Christmas with family and stuff. So, it's got different styles and it could be a great way to kind of keep the kids occupied before it's time to open presents or anything. So, I'm going to give them each and because I have two that want to do the exact same thing, we're going to put the exact same gingerbread house and stickers because if I don't, we're going to be 30,000 ft in the air and I will have triggered my own argument over who should have got what. And well, I want one like hers. If you have multiple kids, you totally you totally get it. Got those. And then I did I don't know how I got two packs of little sheets, but somehow I ended up with two. I don't remember buying two. And here we are. Oh, no. These are just regular sticker sheets. Okay, so we have sticker sheets. I thought these were individual stickers, but this will be fine. So, we've got sticker sheets, and then we also have some of the sticker faces. So, it's the like create a face that they can do. So, we've got Santa, we've got Frosty in here, got a Christmas tree, little gingerbread house, reindeer. You get the idea. So, there's a few different ones. And so, I'm going to make a couple of these. Give them each a Santa. And I'm going to give each of them a gingerbread person and an angel. So, we're going to go with those. Let me grab one other thing, though. Another thing I'm going to throw in there are these little sketch pads. They're from Alyssa and Doug, but they are just blank little sketch pads, and these are going to go great with the sticker sheets. So, they can put those in there. They'll also have I'm going to do some of the regular stickers as well that are the Christmas stickers. My kids love stickers, like obsessed. So, this is going to be a few little regular activities that we can use while we're waiting to board the plane, we're getting on the plane, or once we've got on the plane, that sort of thing. I prefer them to do stuff like this versus just gobs and gobs of tablet time. Um, just because I've been a what I like to call parental scientist and you just test things out with your own kids and for mine, they are in way better moods if I don't just give them unbridled screen time on travel days. That used to be our go-to is it's like, I don't care, it doesn't matter. You do all the screen time you want to. But then I just over the last years, probably 2 years now, really was like, \"Okay, let's see without it.\" And they might ask once or twice to be like, \"Hey, did you bring my tablet?\" Man, I really wish I had my tablet. But they were great. Like, we didn't have as many meltdowns and triggers and things. Even on our road trip, we did minimal tablet screen time. Um, I have the little like flip down DVD players in my Yukon. And on the way down there, which we spent what 16 hours in the car, 15 16 hours in the car. And we watched maybe 2 3 hours worth of TV collectively. And we got there, we were super late, spent all that time in the car, zero meltdowns. Like, we didn't have an issue. When we drove back, we did a lot more of it cuz we were just like, \"Whatever. You've not had a lot of screens this last two weeks. We've been at Disney. We've been having fun. Have some screen time.\" And we did a lot of hours, probably five, maybe six hours of Bluey and all kinds of stuff on the drive home. And we were about an hour and a half, 2 hours out from home and nonstop almost crying out of one of the children. Um, it was, yeah, it was just it was an emotional roller coaster. And we even spent less time in the car. We were only in the car 12 hours on the way home. So we shaved 4 hours off and we were in the car less, like the whole thing. So all that to say, that's just kind of our experience and it's one of those you have to be a scientist. Like these blanket statements are this is what's best for kids or this or that. Like you have to take it with a grain of salt. And if your kids thrive and you're just like, \"Hey, soon as we get in the airport, here's your tablet. Hop in the stroller.\" And you do that, that's great. You are getting zero judgment from me. But it's one of those if it's not working, don't be afraid to try something else and see. And just because someone says, \"Oh, this works great.\" It may not work great for your kids. And that's the beauty of it is you have to be the best mom and dad for your own children and know their needs. So, you know, you are entrusted with them for a reason. It's because you know best, not the internet, as much as they love to think they know best. So, to kind of round this out, I am going in with my packing list and checking off things like I have a stickers and a coloring book. I don't have crayons, which is something that's on my list. I also have Play-Doh, so we're going to count that little snowman as their Play-Doh instead. We've got their backpacks here. Um, we don't have their tablet, don't have their headphones. So, those are things that I still know I need to do. And while I'm looking at these things and my brain is functioning and firing off, I'm going to start a note on my phone and we're gonna call it Disney Christmas trip. And I'm going to just start brain dumping things like charge tablet, charge headphones, I can't spell. Um, charge headphones. I'm also going to put on here travel day snacks for girls, things like that that I know I need to put in there. And then as the trip gets closer, I can go and refer to this. And this is just kind of my brain dump of all the things. So maybe it's one of those things. It's not on the actual packing list or it's something that you need to do. So you need to charge the chargers before you pack them. So it's like that's not necessarily on the packing list of like checking it off, but it's a thing that you need to do. Brain dump it. Just pour it all here. As soon as you think of something, immediately put it on a list, whether it's paper if you want to do on your phone. I like paper anymore because I feel like it's less stimulating, less notifications, less stuff. So, it's one of those I enjoy being old school in paper and pen and it's just I also feel like the more I do that sort of thing and I write things down and I do that then it sticks a little bit better. But it's also easy to put it into your phone. So, you can go in and be able to Okay, I also know I need to add crayons to the girls backpack. So, I can say add crayons to the girls backpack and it's adding it's adding a little too much, but you can go in with a dictation and just quickly add those things in there and be able to have a little satisfactory checklist of knowing that you're getting things checked off. Another thing that I will do, if it's something that you absolutely cannot pack until day of, take yourself a highlighter and highlight those things. Lay this somewhere that the morning of or the day before, whatever, when you're getting closer to your trip that you can highlight it and look at it and remember that, oh, I need to check these things off of my list. This is very helpful. doing those things, kind of prepping those list, getting that brain dump out, and if you're sitting there in bed one night and you've got your phone and you're like, \"Oh, I need to do this.\" Put it on your brain dump. Seriously, do not leave all of that stress up in your head. Knowing that it's on a list that you can refer to and you can add it into your dayto-day. You can look at it. Okay, I'm buying groceries. Let's go ahead and make a list of the travel snacks that I want to get. Or just put on there, buy travel snacks. when you go to the grocery store, you can place your pickup order, whatever. It really, really makes a huge difference. Not just trusting that your brain's going to remember all this stuff, cuz you don't want to remember that you forgot to pack travel snacks or even buy travel snacks at 30,000 ft in the air. Less ideal. And especially if your kid likes something specific or has allergies or like all these things, like you got to have those specific things. So, do yourself and future you a favor and start that brain dump. But I hope this little prep has been helpful. I want to do these like along as the trip is getting closer and closer. So, we'll kind of add to this as it goes. If you have any things that you would like, oh, I'd love to see you prep this or anything, you can go ahead and drop those down in the comment section below. And for my end of the video club, you got to let me know when is your next countdown. Do you have one? If you don't have one, if you could just book a trip, what season would you go in? You have to let me know down in the comment section. But thank you guys so much for hanging out with me, for doing a little prep with me, and I will see you right back here in the next one."

      "transcript": "spending thousands on Disney World just to end up being cringe. Not in this economy. It can ruin the magic, but a lot of people don't even realize that they're breaking these unwritten rules of Disney. And you might be, too. Probably the fastest way to lose your Disney magic isn't by missing out on a dining reservation or forgetting your Lightning Lane window time. It's actually your own reaction. A ride breaks down, the weather goes crazy, as it's prone to do here in Florida. When things go wrong, people explode at the nearest cast member. And I get it. It's so frustrating when you've already invested so much. But the cast member doesn't control any of this. Now, what they do control is how they can help you out when something doesn't go as planned. And cast members are incredible and they're always going to help you. But the secret to maybe getting a little extra magic is kindness. That can go a long way. So, be kind, be respectful, and you may even get a little extra sprinkling of pixie dust on your day. But also, let the magic moment be a surprise. One way to guarantee you won't get that extra sprinkling of pixie dust is to ask for something magical. On this channel, we believe that cast members are the Disney difference. But not remaining cool and kind towards a cast member isn't the only rule that people break. And the next one actually ruins the show for everyone, including yourself. Disney nerds, I love you. I am you. But shouting the stretching room scene in the Haunted Mansion, so cringe. It spoils that goosebump inducing kind of surprise moment for first timers. So don't quote ride scripts or shout the narration to Happily Ever After. Instead, use your Disney knowledge to point out things like hidden Mickeyy's. That's the kind of Disney nerd everyone likes. Y'all, this next one, it's not just cringe. It's like actually dangerous. Although, before we get into that, I just want to say I am all about living your best Disney life. Hey, I skip down Main Street. I take way too many videos of my food and I talk to a camera in the middle of one of the busiest places in the world. cringe maybe, but it's cringe in a way that doesn't block other people's fun. So, 1,000% have fun. Be yourself. Because really, when we're all having fun together, that's when the magic really hits. If you want to trigger instant chaos, which I don't know why you would, but if you did, stop in the middle of fantasy land. Oh my gosh. Well, stop in the middle of any busy walkway at Disney World. People start spilling $6 Cokes and now there are strollers hitting your ankles. It is absolute chaos. So, if you need to stop and check your phone or check the Disney app, totally cool. Just step off to the side out of the packed walkway. Is this haunted room actually stretching or are you killing the magic of the haunted mansion in 1 second? How is that possible? Having your flash on in any dark ride exposes the not so magical things. I mean, so many cameras and even like iPhones nowadays are really capable of getting great quality pictures in the dark even without the flash on. Most of the time it is totally accidental. So, turn off your auto flash before you get to Florida. And as someone who has gotten a million mansion videos and pictures, just enjoy the ride with your eyes. It is so much more magical that way. The castle, the hubgrass, everyone wants the perfect picture to remember their Disney trip. And you're looking super cute and you're Disneybound. So get your pictures. But where it can turn cringe is when you're having like a fullon photo shoot in the middle of a really busy and popular place. Like a line around you grows. People are kind of like awkwardly waiting to see are you done with your pictures? Because a lot of times people will wait so they don't ruin your picture, which is super nice. So when you're ready to take a picture, be on it, smile, snap it. That way your magical memories stay just as magical. Oh my gosh. Wait, before we get to the next cringe moment, a very not cringe moment. [Music] So cute. Oh, okay. This next one is actually about something that can happen to everyone. And that is, you know, it's hot, the lines are long, this water bottle is way too expensive, which it is, but that is not setting the right expectations. Set your expectations before you come down and decide that you're going to enjoy it anyway. Have you ever missed a magical Disney moment because you were staring at your phone? Totally been there. I mean, we got Goofy and Pluto right beside us and we are just nose down in our screen. I'm just missing it all because I'm checking weight times instead of living in the moment. Phones are a necessity now when you're on a Disney trip. But if at all possible, try to check your phone while you're waiting in line, not while you're walking through some of the most gorgeous theming in the whole world. Also, pro tip from someone who has learned the hard way. It's so tempting to record the fireworks on your phone, but then you're watching this absolutely incredible moment through a very tiny screen. But if you're like, I really want those gorgeous fireworks, totally hear you. So, if you're here at Magic Kingdom watching the fireworks, wait until you see Tinkerbell come down from the castle. Start recording from that moment on because you're going to get to watch the majority of the show and you're actually going to get video of the very best fireworks since they always save them for the very end. But here's the thing, cringe behavior isn't the only way a Disney trip can go wrong. Rookie mistakes can waste your precious time, money, and energy. So tap this video right here where I break down the biggest mistakes you have to avoid. And if you recognize yourself in any of these cringe-worthy moments in this video, same. Although the difference now is that you know how to avoid them so that you and everyone around you can have a more magical Disney day. That's right, train. I'm Molly and I'll meet you on Main Street."

      "transcript": "I I [Music] take me home today. Take me out to take me back into sweet. Good morning everyone and welcome to a brand new Disney in Detail vlog. And you probably can't see my outfit very well. Got my bag across my front, but I've got my Halloween t-shirt on because today we are off to Mickey's Nots So Scary Halloween Party. I absolutely love the Halloween and Christmas parties in the Magic Kingdom. Cla is really excited, too. She loved the Halloween party last year. She's already over in the lobby because she's been having a wander around the resort just while I was finishing getting ready. We've had a later start this morning because the party goes on till quite late. We likely might be there till like 1:00 a.m. or something. So, we didn't want to get started too early cuz that would be a long day. And before we start the party, we are going to be eating at Crystal Palace with the Winnie the Pooh characters. I've done that before. So is Claire actually with her family. Um me and Catherine absolutely loved it. It's such a fun experience and we loved Tuska House yesterday. So really looking forward to that too. So loads to come in this vlog. We're just going to head into Town Square Theater because there is a shop inside here and there's the secret ear shop which is quite hidden away. And also this guy got to come and see Mr. Toad. I mean the shop back here is not totally hidden but it is kind of not necessarily common knowledge that it exists. It's huge. enormous shop. Yeah. Oh, it's the orange bird hat. How hot would that be, though? Oh my gosh. Yeah. This is wearing at maybe Disneyland Paris in the winter. Yeah. Or in January when I was here in Disney World. That would have actually been quite nice. There was a day in Epcot that was properly freezing. That's so funny. [Laughter] There we go. Nice. Yeah. I definitely don't want to be walking around outside in this. They also have HeiiHi. I reckon that would be really funny as well. Cla's thinking about this. I want a classic t-shirt really at some point. But yeah, I think there's going to be one item of clothing I buy. So, I'm kind of debating between a few things. Yeah, I'm at the moment the front runner for me is the Inside Out sweatshirt that we saw at Disney Springs last night. But this is why I like to keep looking cuz you might see something else. Yeah, they actually have a lot of stuff in here. all the Halloween apparel, a lot of the other Halloween items, and the Main Street Emporium is always very busy. So, if you are looking for ears, hats, or the seasonal apparel, and some of the classic stuff, too, I would come in here and look first because this is so much more of a relaxing experience than when you are in the emporium. Look at this. Oh my gosh, how cute. The little haunted mansion one as well. Look, look at the little trousers. Yeah, they are cute. Oh my goodness. Oh, and what's underneath? Oh, is it like a little Oh, it's a hat. Oh my gosh, the hat. That's so cute. Yeah, that is very cute. Looks like everyone is gathering for the Festival of Fantasy Parade. I think we're going to go and grab a drink and we might see some of it as it goes by. If you want to see a video of like the full parade or most of it, I have a really good one when we just stood kind of high up over there from a previous trip. So, I'll link that blog below. Oh, the smell that is coming out of the confectionary. It's so good. I can hear it starting. So, we're going to grab our drink and we might be able to catch a little bit of it. What should I have today is the question. I may potentially have like a frappuccino. That sounds quite nice. With some coffee in it, obviously. There goes the dragon. I'm still in here getting the coffee. We have got our drinks. And this is really overloaded as well. It was coming out the top and everything. Like loads of cream. this mocka cookie crumble um frappuccino. You have to ask for it. It's not on the menu, but most of the places do still do it. And it is so good. And you can get it with or without coffee. Obviously, I get it with Oh my gosh, that is so good. It's like a dessert though. And we are eating soon. And we just ran into Paul and Paul. So, hi to you guys. It's lovely to chat to you. And you also told me to say hi to Paul. So, easy to remember. We love meeting you guys. And already we've met some people this morning. And I'm sure a lot of you will be at the Halloween party tonight as well. And Cla has got the um it was called something different on the menu, but it is the drink that you like, isn't it? It was iced pumpkin chai latte. So it was an easier name, but it is basically the same as what it was what you had last year. Yeah. But she did say cuz I was asking her about the drinks and she says they never know like what's coming back from a previous year cuz I said about the chestnut pralien latte which is my favorite and she said we never really know. It might do, it might not. Yeah. So, November, they may have it. It's been my favorite for years. The parade has now finished. Actually, the whole time the parade was on, it took us to get our coffees. So, we didn't see it today, but we may see it another day. But, like I said, I will link that video below and you can see a really good view of it. It's time for our reservation at Crystal Palace. I'll see you guys. A poo bear. [Music] Poo. [Music] Thank you. Oh, you got a kiss as well. Thank you. But I give you a kiss, too. A I love it here so much. It's really, really fun. I think out of the two, the one we did yesterday and the one we did today, I do love Tusker House the most. I think what it is is like the way that Goofy and Donald and everybody was, it's just a little bit more like fun and bouncy, high energy. Yeah. So, I mean, out of all of these, like Tiger is probably the most energetic and obviously Eeyore is not like I've actually felt like I wanted to cry when I saw Eeyore cuz he's just so sad. But yeah, the Tuska House is a bit more high energy and I feel like you see the characters more Tuska House. So, we have seen the characters more than once since we've been here, but as we've been here, look who's here. Hi, Piglet. We were just talking about you. In a good way. In a good way. Don't worry. So full up now, though. We've had too much. Yeah. I can't even manage pudding. No. No. I am so full, but I have enjoyed all of it. Yay. Oh, it's so nice to see you. Bye. Hi, baby. So, we have seen the characters multiple times and we sort of took photos with them the first time and then they still come around and we said hi to them again every single time. I was just talking to Paul on FaceTime and he got to say hi to Eeyore as well which is really cool. So it is an amazing experience and the food here I would say I like as I probably liked the stuff yesterday a tiny bit more. Yeah. Um but I love here as well. Like I actually when I did 1900 park fair I really enjoyed the food there as well. So the buffet restaurants I do really like the food. So here I had like Oh my goodness me. Yeah. Here I've um had I had some salad again. I know it seems a bit boring to have salad and actually Victoria always says that she's having salad, doesn't she? Like in all of her other vlogs and I think come on Victoria, I'm more than salad. But I do but like well I do really like salad but I think it's because like so much other food is so rich and you're having like the sweet treats and things. So salad sometimes you you're just craving healthy goodness in your body and and there's like such a range of salad stuff and like pastury salads and potato salads and couscous and things. It's really really tasty. Yeah, everything I had was actually really nice. Yeah, I just can't manage pudding, which is a bit of a shame. Yeah, I'm too cool for that. Yeah, the food really is quite good at all of the buffets that I've been to. I don't really think there's any that I haven't liked the food. When I went to Chef Mickey's, I didn't overly enjoy the experience, but the food was actually nice, to be fair. So, yeah, food wise, really good. It is more pricey than going to another restaurant by the plaza or something across the way, but the characters are really, really cute. It's so nice interacting with them, taking photos. The kind of setting in here as well is really beautiful. So, I would definitely recommend it. If you were only going to do one though, I would probably do Tuska House. Unless you specifically really love the Winnie the Pooh characters, then definitely I would do here. Yeah. On my first trip, we did come and do this because I love the 100 Acre. And then on our second trip, we were going to do Tuska House. Obviously, it just didn't work. But this is great. And I was showing Victoria a little video of my children, and they absolutely loved it. They were doing the conga around um the Crystal Palace with I think it was with Tiger and Pooh and yeah, so many children joined in. It is great fun. Yeah. And just for me as well cuz I've obviously known Cla for years and years and years before she had the children. Now that they're teenagers and they're older, it was so cute seeing this little video of the two of them when Cla first came here. Um I loved that. Like actually seeing them in here in Crystal Palace. You also don't feel rushed. So there's no need to like feel rushed. that never happens. Overall, a great experience. And it's really nice to do something like this before the party cuz when the party begins, there is a lot going on then. You're going from place to place, maybe trying to do character meet and greets, going around trick-or-treating and fireworks, parades. Like, there's a lot happening. So, it's quite nice to do something like this very chilled to start off your time at the party. And like I said, we did this at 3. Sorry if the camera is wobbling, by the way. It's a very wobbly table. It's nice to do something like this before it gets going because it is quite a full-on evening doing the party. But we're very excited for it. Once we get out of here, we're going to go and get our wristbands and everything and kind of get thinking about what we want to do first. I always do the later parade. Um, so I watch the fireworks and then I stay in the same spot usually then for the parade and then once the parade finishes, the that's the second parade by the way. Um, then I watch the Sanderson Sisters show and I always do it in that format and it works really well. There is a parade earlier in the evening, but it's very busy because then a lot of families with younger children will watch that one and then leave. So, I always do the second parade. But, yeah, we're really excited for it. I think the weather is going to hold off. Um, I don't think there's going to be any more rain. Fingers crossed for us. I don't know if you could see my t-shirt properly earlier, but this is the one I have. So, it's like a mini, but it's got all the different Halloweeny elements on it. So, I love this. There you are. See? And there's my little girl. She's bouncing around. Very happy to see you. And that's my son coming along as well. There you go. They're joining you going around. A isn't it nice. So yeah, I will remember that forever. A thank you so much. Oh, we love you. Thank you. So, we're just getting ready to leave and it is raining quite heavily. So, we're going to have to get the umbrellas out and fingers crossed that it doesn't keep up. And also, one thing I've observed here, they used to have the characters going around in a little parade. Um, that's what Cla was showing to Pooh Bear of her children doing the little conga thing around the restaurant. They haven't done that this time and they did it when me and Catherine were here. So, I don't know if that's something they just haven't done today or whether that's gone away, but it was quite cute when they used to do that and the characters had little flags and stuff. So, I don't know why that didn't happen, but I thought that was just worth mentioning. So, we're going to get going now. Even though it's raining, we're going to go and get our wristbands, the wristband collection areas. You can either go to Adventureland by Tortuga Tavern or Mickey's Filhar Magic or over by Monsters Inc. Love Floor. That's if you're already in the park before the party begins. If you are coming in with just a Halloween party ticket, you'll be given your wristband upon entering the park. But if you're already in the park, those are places that you can go to get it. And then hopefully by the time it comes to fireworks, parades, the stage show, and things like that later in the evening, the rain might have stopped. Hopefully. Just picked up our wristbands. Cla's sporting hers. We've got our little bag there for our trick-or-treating and everything. And it has the map inside. And I've noticed it's also got some like M&M's in there as well. Purple M&M getting us going on the trick-or-treating. And we are going to go back to Main Street to get the pin, but we're just going to do Pirates. It's 15 minutes. It's raining as you can see. So, we thought this would be a good time to just go into a ride and then we'll walk back that way. Hopefully, the rain will lease off and hopefully we won't get splashed by the cannons. No, cuz then we'll be soaked anyway. So, and it's 6:00 on the dot at the moment and the cast member was asking to see everybody's wristband to come into the ride. So, the park officially closes at 6:00 to guests who don't have a ticket and they obviously are very on it with making sure nobody slips through to get on the rides after 6:00 p.m. So, that's worth knowing. If you are here just for the day, you will have to be kind of done with getting on rides by 6. That's actually pretty good. This is a clear run for doing the pirate dance if ever there was one. I do love the queueing area and all the little details. We're in Cannonball territory and we're sitting in the middle of the boat hoping to avoid it. [Music] It got my hand a little bit, but that wasn't too bad. That wasn't too bad. [Laughter] That one was unexpected. [Music] A hand for a 10. I'll give you 20 for the wrong. [Music] I do love this. You can get Pluto with the keys in his mouth. A which is really cute. Yeah. Blow the dog at the end. But it's our Pluto instead. Just in the line for the party merchandise. And there is a bit of a queue here, but it's not too bad. You can see the spirit jersey there. It's like a pale purple color this year. Says boo to you on the back. And these are the ears. You got Dracula Mickey on one side and the castle on the other. They have this shirt as well. I actually really like that one. Some of these pins have already sold out. Let's see what this one is. That's specifically the villain spectacular. spelltacular, I should say. Or this one. I think I'm going to get this one with the gravedigger on. I like that. They have this mug, which I'm assuming this is a mug, but it doesn't actually have a handle. It has at wings. Mickey's not So scary 2025. It is pretty neat. I really like the design, but I don't know. Would that be weird to drink out of? Or would you have soup out of it or something? Maybe. Then they have this, which I'm guessing is like a trick or treat thing, you know, like a bag. It's 7:00 p.m. So, the party is now starting as you can tell from the music. We'll just be taking a few photos and we're going to be going over this way. When you come to the party, they will filter you down this backstage area, which is not normally an area that's open. It's just to make sure everybody gets into the park and the daytime guests come out of the park. The rain has eased off for now, thank goodness. So, we will see what happens. There is some blue sky up there, so we're hopeful that we're not going to have rain all evening. It has showered quite heavily a few times, but that has been the case this week and last week for the parties. It has been quite rainy, so it just is what it is. This time of year, you can never ever guarantee good weather. It's rainy season, so you know, it's pretty much every day at some point or another. And here in Town Square Theater is where you can meet Jack and Sally. This is one of the biggest meet and greets of the evening. And it's currently 65 minutes. So, this is right at the beginning of the party, like 7:15, and it's 65 minutes. That probably will stay quite consistent, I would think. The other big meet and greet that you have is the Winnie the Pooh characters in their Halloween costumes. That's over by the Winnie the Pooh ride. If we go past there, I will show you. I have done that one before and it was about the same. I think I waited about an hour at the beginning of the party. So, that's kind of what you can expect for these very special meet and greets. Yeah, this area would normally be closed off. You're ready to party. I can tell they have someone meeting and greeting this year. Trick or treat with those jerseys on. Hi, welcome. Did you have fun celebrating tonight? [Music] Thank you so much. Thank you. Green tricks and orange shriers. Skittles. Say hi, Megan Cleo. Hi, Megan Cleo. Hey, you folks walking up front didn't say Maggie Cleo. You got to say Maggie Cleo. Maggan Cleo. Incredible man. Everybody, welcome aboard the people mover presented by Enterprise. I'm Oric 5, your guide aboard this highway in the sky. And my stars, is there ever lots to see? From spacecraft to monster labs, there's really nothing like today in Tomorrowland. The next station is Tomorrowland Urban Planning and Star Traders. Transfer to Green and Red Lines. Don't worry, your express train keeps on rolling through the future. On your right is Star Traders, home to the greatest goods in the galaxy, except actual stars. The Rima [Music] right is the astral orbiter, our celestial symbol of interplanetary harmony and fellowship. [Music] Got a dance party going on over here. The dance floor is open and my squad is down there with you. So, be sure to show off those amazing dance moves. Claire has gone to Ryron because it's only a 35minute wait at the moment, which is pretty low, but I'm going to stay around here, do some filming of some of the party stuff. So, I'm going to go into Auntie Gravity's cuz I know they've got some of the Halloween snacks in there. I'm going to take a look at the leaflet in a second and we can see if there's any other Halloween snacks that we need to check out. Some of these snack items are available during the parties and during the daytime as well. Some of them are specific. They have a cauldron cold brew which is Joffrey's coffee, pumpkin spice foam and Halloween sprinkles. A candy bowl sundae and that's salted caramel soft serve with all kinds of different candy on top. Then also in here just the regular stuff. They got churros, salted caramel cold brew floats, other types of floats. So, your choice of assorted fountain beverage with soft serving. So, I don't think I'm going to get any of that today. I'm going to look in the leaflet in a second and see what other snacks they have. Let's take a walk through Star Traders as well cuz they do have some Halloween stuff here. I saw this bag earlier in the Emporium actually and I didn't get chance to show it to you cuz it was so busy. And on the strap, it says Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party. And then you got Dracula, Mickey, and the castle. That's actually pretty neat. And it is kind of big. Like, I don't know if you can kind of see. I think you'd get quite a lot in there. I think I see some ears over here that I've never seen before. These fluffy ones. And they've got tiny little hearts on the bow there. Then they have the Cruella Deville fluffy ones. We've seen those before. I'm not 100% sure I've seen these Monsters Inc. ones. They're actually really funny. The Tomorrowland Loungefly bag is actually really nice. I saw this Spirit jersey last time I was here. I think that's really nice. And they have this pink one which is more princessy themed. I love this Loungefly bag. I've been eyeing a very similar one for quite some time, but this one is slightly different. Oh my gosh, look at this Pluto sweatshirt. Love that. And there's a villain's hoodie here. This is nice. I haven't seen this mug before. I often find that here in Star Traders, they do have a few things that you don't always see anywhere else. So, if you like to hunt down merchandise that's new, here is a good place to come. And I know during the Christmas party, the teacup ride has an overlay. I'm not sure if it does for the Halloween party. So, let's get a bit closer and we can see if it's the same or if they have like spooky music for this one. I love the kind of spooky colors in the trees. And look down here. Got the trees and the queen is out here doing a meet and greet. And you also had the Mad Hatter over here. One of the biggest character meet and greets of the night is just over here and that's the Winnie the Pooh characters that I was telling you about earlier. This is the end of the line just back here. So, it is kind of a long line. I will put in a photo or a little bit of footage or something of last time I did meet the characters. And when I was just walking past this a minute ago, it did appear that the lighting looked different. So, I'm just going to wait for the next cycle to go around and we can see whether there's any different music. [Applause] [Music] So, it does have a special overlay for the party. That's really neat. I love that they do that on that attraction because it's not a big ticket attraction or anything, but then during the party nights, it's fun to ride it cuz it's a little bit different. I'm just going to find somewhere to sit down and take a proper look at the leaflet cuz I haven't done that yet. and I'll be able to see what snack I might want to get because I do feel a snack coming on and double check the timing of the parades and the fireworks and everything to make sure I'm in the right place at the right time. During the party, Mickey's Filha Magic is another treat station. I am going to go in because last time they were showing and Mr. Toad on the big screen in there. So, I just want to see if they've got anything like that this time. Oh, Donald is over here in his super cute pumpkin outfit. Stop by only. Please do not stop and hold up the line. Okay, let's see if they are showing anything interesting in here. They are showing it. I'm going to sit here and read my leaflets and take in a little bit of this while I'm here. Who's the owner of that uh looking car? I love Mr. Toad. Okay, I'm going to read this to you guys while we're sat here cuz there's nobody around me so it won't bother anyone. The Boutie Parade is on at 8:15 and 11:15. So, we're hoping to see the 11:15 one. the show at the castle. The latest one is midnight. So, we're going to see that one at midnight. And the fireworks are at 1000 p.m. So, that's the first thing that I need to get in position for later. It does mention the specialty food and beverage, but they don't have all of the items on here. There's just a few highlights. Just over here by the Rapunzel restrooms, and this is where you can get the lantern photo. A lot of you will have seen this before. Someone's having it taken here now. There is always a long line for it, though. I am just going to see what the wait time is for the mansion because it almost seems wrong not to on a Halloween party night. If it's a very long line, then I won't because I've obviously done it lots of times before and I would imagine it is quite popular on these party nights. I love the spooky mist going on here. It is a 30 minute wait. I think I won't because I do want to get in position in time for the fireworks and have a snack before then. And you guys have seen the haunted mansion lots of times. I would say the parade has just finished and this is what's going on here. probably wasn't a good idea to come this way. One thing I'm noticing about this party over others is how busy it is. It is pretty extremely busy compared to what I'm used to. The parade has just kind of finished, but the trick or treat line is all the way back there past Liberty Tree Tavern. I don't know whether they've sold more tickets this year. Maybe I've happened to go on quieter days, but yeah, it is super super busy. I can woo woo woo. Then I can woo woo wahoo for the rest of my days. [Applause] Woohoo. [Music] [Applause] I betray to you till we [Music] I came in here to see if there was anything going on. There isn't really on the stage or anything. It is just a trick or treat station. Look who we've got now. It's the hitchhiking ghosts. I love this. [Music] Aloha is open during the party so that you can get your doll whip fix. And we've got Aladdin meeting and greeting over here. [Music] This is Halloween. This is a night we've all ever seen. When the villains and the heroes party with the king I'm just heading over to Golden Oak Outpost because I believe they have the beignes from beyond which are special Halloween party beignetes. And I think those are exclusive to the party. So that's the stack I've decided to go for. Hopefully they still have some. There's a pretty long line here. So the beignes are obviously popular. There's the picture of them and they do have Tiana's famous bees which are just the regular ones. I feel like my hair is just growing by the second. I'm not normally affected by humidity with my hair. It normally just stays straight. But even mine is going crazy and getting really bushy. So that just goes to show how humid it is. I'm here in Pico's Bill. If you're wondering where Cla is, she was riding Tron and I think she's gone to write Tiana's afterwards before watching the fireworks. I tend to skip things like that during the parties because I just like to show you as much party specific stuff as I can. So, I don't tend to do a lot of the rides. People mover like has no line, but anything that has a line, I tend to leave that for other days when I'm in the parks. I brought my beignet in here and I'm going to have these and by the time I've done that, it's going to be time for the fireworks. And Cla and I have decided to do what we did last time and show you two different perspectives to watch the fireworks. One thing that I've realized this evening because it's so crowded even in here other nights that I've done these parties whether it's being Halloween or Christmas. If I come in here around this time there's virtually nobody in here and almost every single table is taken. It's really really busy. And when you're watching fireworks and stuff I know there's a lot of people who struggle with really having a lot of crowds and a lot of people around you. For me I actually struggle myself with that for a slightly different reason. My balance is not very good. So when I have a lot of people around me, I do feel nervous about being bumped or knocked into because my balance is bad. So I actually do prefer to watch the fireworks from somewhere where I'm not going to be in too much of a crowd. I know for some people you find it uncomfortable or nerve-wracking for other reasons. So I just like to show a different perspective that you can still enjoy the fireworks without being in those crowds. So Cla's going to watch from in front of the castle and take a little bit of footage of that. I'm going to watch from behind the castle. Normally I sit around where the diamond horseshoe is or kind of around where Phil her magic is. So I'm going to see which spot I decide to go for and we'll show you the fireworks from both of those. Then we are going to reconvene for the parade. I'm going to eat these beignes and then go and get into position for that. You actually get three of the beignes and it's got powdered sugar on top and then they sprinkle some little Halloween pumpkins and little decor things on top. And also there is a dip which I think is like a cookie cream dip almost I guess like an Oreo or something. They do have some Haunted Mansion beignes at the moment over at Portal's French Quarter. Those beignes over there are top tier. If you ever want to try bees, I would recommend you go to French Quarter cuz the ones there are so good and their special Halloween ones are Mickey shakes and I think they've got like other stuff on top. This is the kind of size and you get three like that. And you actually could have had this as a snack credit as well if you're just paying for them. They're $8.79. I bought a bottle of water as well, so my total was 13 36. Yeah, they're $8.79 plus tax basically if you're paying for them. Oh my gosh, that just smells like buttercream frosting. The dip is basically buttercream frosting and I'm not mad about it. The actual beignetes themselves, they are a little drier than the ones over at French Quarter. So, I would say these aren't quite as good, but they are still really nice. They are very, very messy. The ones over at French Quarter, I feel like they're more almost like a donut. These ones are kind of like hollow inside and just a little bit harder. I'm getting powdered sugar everywhere. I think I'm going to need to lean forward. Oh my gosh, it's on my bag and everything. They are good. I don't know that I would get them again though because I really love the ones over our French Quarter. So, I think if I was going to get beignetes, I would just go over there to get them. But these are nice. I am in position for the fireworks literally right here at the Diamond Horseshoe. This is a spot that I've sat in a lot of times before for various different fireworks, either just the normal ones, Halloween ones, Christmas ones. I always find this quite good. You can just kind of look straight over and see all of the main big fireworks. And actually, I think I might stay here for the parade and just snag a spot straight away after the fireworks are done. If you do want a good spot for the parade, you really do need to grab it quite early. Um, otherwise you will end up like several people behind and it can then be a bit difficult to see. So yeah, I would recommend it if you really want to see the parade clearly to try and grab a spot quite early on. Hey. Hey. Hey. [Music] [Music] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Applause] [Music] your diamond. [Music] [Applause] Heat. [Music] to [Music] [Music] head. Right. [Music] [Laughter] We are in position for the parade right by this pillar here. This is outside the diamond horseshoe. You can see how many people are already in position and there's still 35 minutes until the break. So, so busy. Yeah, this is busier than last year, isn't it? Totally. Compared to last year, I like I mean, obviously when I walked down to try and find you when you were here, I couldn't get through. But the it was only like one line at the fence, so I could see. I just couldn't see perfectly. But like even the fireworks earlier when I was stood by the cast I couldn't believe it when I walked up there. Like, it was absolutely jam-packed. Whereas last year, I just kind of walked in, found a good spot, and that was it. Yeah. Excuse the lighting, cuz there is a green light that keeps coming in and out. Um, yeah, I've been doing this event for 16 years. Is that right? My gosh. Yeah, 16 years. And this is one of the busiest I've ever seen it. It really is. Like, when I was watching the fireworks, I was amazed at how many people weren't actually watching. They were just like walking around. And then while we've been stood here for um waiting for the parade, the candy thing behind me at the Diamond Horseshoe has had a massive line. Um that just isn't normally the case at this point in the night. But the weird thing me and CLA were saying, it did say sold out last year, didn't it, while we were here? Yeah, it really did. And then tonight says sold out, but this is like so much busier. So maybe they've sold a lot more tickets this year. They must have done no way that it can be this different. No. Yeah. I have just heard that the Headless Horseman didn't go earlier because of the rain in the earlier parade. I guess it was because of the rain. So that would explain why a lot of people have waited until this second one. But yeah, we are going to get to see the Headless Horseman this time. So that's exciting. It really is a highlight of this parade. I love it. Beware, the Headless Horseman is here. [Music] [Applause] to la. [Music] [Music] [Music] to hope you're having a good time. It's not so scary. Wow, you look terrific. It's really not so scary. [Music] I look like Captain [Music] Happy [Music] Yo, [Music] no. [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] That's right. You [Music] and you and you. Happy Halloween. [Music] [Music] my brother [Music] [Music] tickle twinkle. Give me something [Music] [Music] for everybody. [Music] This is my very [Music] [Music] [Applause] in my life from [Music] [Applause] [Music] As Halloween [Music] this is inside the diamond horseshoe just to show you what it looks like in here. [Music] That is so [Music] Hello ladies in the show with me. A man and who are you? A tip of the hat from the one and only Dr. Pastier, also known as the shadow realm. [Music] My my another party to which I wasn't invited. Magnificent, your excellency, if you would help us with the last ingredient. And that would be sprinkle bread. Sprinkle. Your legends. We invited and compelled here a slithering snake with a sorcerer's power to give us a Time to party. [Applause] I'm a lady. I'll be a lady. Christmas and I [Music] you strong [Music] I [Music] baby. [Music] [Music] Well, you can see we are in our little spot or my favorite little spot. This is off the side of Main Street and there is quite loud music, but we're hoping because we've got the microphones that you might still be able to hear us. So, fingers crossed. Hopefully, fingers crossed there's no copyright issues. If there is, I'll have to deal with that. That's a problem for future me. We thought we'd do a little roundup while we're here because everyone is heading for the buses and we didn't want to necessarily deal with that very initial. everybody else go off. And it means that we're obviously a little bit later, but that's way better to just get on the bus and go. Yeah, we don't want to. We're so like stiff at this point from walking. We don't want to stand up. And it's now looking 12:40. Yeah. Yeah. 12:40 a.m. So that is kind of the time that I say 12:30 really is the last show has finished, the stage show, and you're yawning and then you know that's why you're so tired. Um, so we just wanted to basically talk about the party cuz everybody always says to me, \"Is it worth it? Should we do it?\" And all of that kind of thing. So the first thing, which I've mentioned several times already, it was way busier. Yeah, it was crazy busier than like compared to last year. I don't think that meant that I wouldn't have wanted to have done it though. No, I didn't find there were only a couple of moments that I found it a little bit much and that was literally when the first parade had finished and everyone was like dispersing. I did get a bit snalled up in that, but I mean that is something that can happen to you when Festival of Fantasy finishes. Yeah. So, that's not really an issue. The other time that it was a little bit um like you kind of felt like you were going to be a bit squashed was you were stood waiting after the fireworks had finished. You were kind of in your little spot trying to keep the place. And I came up and met Victoria and then it was right by what was it? The Diamond Horseshoe. Yeah. Right in front of there. and the people were queuing in there to do their trick or treat and like pick up their candy and literally everyone was walking behind us and you sort of felt like you were going to be trampled at one point. So, but that you said you've literally never seen it that busy going in to for people to pick up their candy. So, you didn't expect it? No. Oh, my hair is like turning into a triangle. Sorry, I've just looked how fluffy it is. This the fluffiest hair I've ever had. Yeah. The only times I have seen big cues for candy is normally when the party first begins. So, people do come in and you will see those lines for the candy. That is fairly typical, but I've never seen those massive lines later in the night. Usually after the fireworks, no, never. Normally after the fireworks, if you go to any of the trick-or- treat stations, then there will be people there, but you just walk through. Whereas, there was still cues for things like that, like after fireworks, wasn't there? And and after the parade. Yeah, even after the second parade. So definitely it was busier. The parade was amazing as always. And the Headless Horseman didn't go the first time, but he did the second. So we saw that and it was great. Absolutely loved it. Yeah, it was really, really good. I mean, and and I loved it that we had that good spot at the front cuz then you could completely see everything. The ones that I like the most are the the guys with the Yeah. that are like scratching on the floor and then the dancers from Haunted Mansion. as well. I mean, I'm sure there was others as well that were really good, but those are the two that stick in my head. And then obviously the fireworks. I mean, I was watching it like front on and they were so good. I remember that from last year. They're amazing. And then just at the end like having a dance around. It's so good. So, I mean when what I always say about this event, it really for me everything that's great about it is right at the end. So 1000 p.m. onwards. So you've got fireworks, then parade, then I always watch the last stage show. You can of course watch the stage show earlier than that. Um but the fireworks and the stage show plays earlier as well. Yeah, there's several several of them throughout the night. That same one same one. Yeah, yeah, that runs maybe three or four times throughout the party. So that you can see earlier, but the fireworks in the parade or parades are the times that are obviously set. You can see the earlier parade, but generally speaking, that's a lot busier. The beignetes that I had were nice, but I probably wouldn't get them again. They were nowhere near as good as ones from French Quarter, so that was just okay. There were a lot of snacks that you could have had, though. They had lots of the quick services. Lots of the kiosks had different snacks that you could have had. There's never enough time to kind of get round to all the snacks. And Well, there's never enough time to do everything in Disney ever. No. No. But if you did like two character meet and greets, that would be 2 hours gone. So say the party starts at 7:00, you could get to 9:00 p.m. and do two character meet greets and then it's obviously 9:00. If you wanted to do a little bit of trick-or-treating and get a snack, that could easily take you then to the firework time. Yeah. Then it's the Do you know what I mean? What it's just so hard to do everything. Another thing that was different, we went to get a hot chocolate or I was going to probably get a coffee from Starbucks. Last time I when I've been here for the Christmas parties as well after I've watched the stage show, I have been able to go into Starbucks and this time they were closed. So, there wasn't anywhere to then get a drink after that. So, just bear that in mind as well. Have you got Yeah, I think so. Oh, no. Overall, I would say how I feel about this party. I've been going to this event, like I said earlier, for 16 years now. most years for the last 16 years I've done it. And if I was coming on holiday and I came out to Florida every year, I probably wouldn't do it every year. I might do it every other or every third year. I do it every year because I want to be able to show you guys and let you know what I think if there's anything new and all of that sort of thing. So, I do do it every year for that reason and the Christmas one if I'm here at that time. But probably if I was on holiday, I would do it every other third year. Yeah. You don't have to do it every year. I feel like I preferred it last year, but that might be because I'd never seen it before, so it's just super exciting to see it. But I think also um the crowds like it was it definitely was busier this year than it was last year. And I don't really understand why, like we said, cuz it was they said it was um sold out last year, but it was way quieter. Yeah, definitely. So, I don't understand. And also I do think the rain at the beginning of the evening. Yeah, that's true. So when we got out of Crystal Palace, I will be honest, it was raining so much that period of time where we were getting our um wristbands and trying to figure out what to do, it was kind of putting a dampener on the mood a little bit. Yeah. Because it was raining so much. Yeah. I mean, there's nothing like nothing can be done about that. That's not like Disney's fault, is it? No. I will say though, if you get totally rained off on one of these parties, it is going to spoil it a little bit. Sometimes you can speak to Disney and see if they can do anything about it. I did get rained off at a Christmas party a few years back. Um, if you remember that one, you'll remember it cuz it was honestly ridiculous. Like I it was just raining the whole time. I didn't bother getting a refund because like I say, I kind of do these things for showing them in the vlogs. But if I had have been on holiday and that happened, it would have felt like such a bummer. And the Christmas party is even more expensive than the Halloween one. So, you can't predict the weather, but especially not at this time of year, you do get a lot of rain. So, it is one of those things. You are kind of taking a bit of a chance there. But, I do feel like if it rained the whole night, I would have been gutted. Very sad. Yeah, it would have been very very much a bummer, but we were lucky. So, we had a bit at the beginning and then very much thankfully it was. I know. I know. I kind of didn't want to say it just in case I jinxed it, but I was I was thinking Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. And we did get um the candy. We did do a few. I probably did. So, you did more than me. I did a couple with you and Well, I did whichever ones you did and two others in total. And I do feel like I have quite a lot of candy from doing maybe five candy stops. And I have a lot of green Twixes. Yeah, I know. Green in the middle. I've eaten most of the Twixes, but so I was pleased that we then went and got more. Yeah. So I I think I've had one little thing of Skittles so far, but the candy is good. It's a bonus. Obviously, it's a lot of money for candy. You could just go to Target and buy yourself some candy, but it's not the same as trick-or-treating in the Magic Kingdom. So, I always enjoy this event. I will say I've never ever come to it and not liked it. If you've never done it before, I would say definitely you will enjoy it cuz it's something very different. The parade and the fireworks alone are great and the stage show. Yeah, you guys will know if you've been around a long time, I am not a fan of the Christmas stage show, but because I love Christmas and I will say the vibe in the Magic Kingdom when you've got the Snoke on Main Street and it's just something else and and also I'm get like all the decorations with the Christmas decorations that's special. and the Christmas parade with the toy soldiers and gingerbread men, like it is worth it as well for the Christmas one, but it is more expensive. So, I've been looking into it for Paul and I. And I think the Christmas party is 150 per person. And I feel like we paid about 120 for this if I remember correctly. I think it was 113. 13. That's right. So, it is a bit less. Not It's not massive difference, but it's still a difference. You've got Elvis waving in the background. Hi. Love your costume. That is amazing. The other thing is that's great the costumes. Seeing other people's costumes, some of them are amazing. Yeah, like that guy's costume is amazing. The Leota that we saw earlier. I've seen a lot of family costumes where people have got like um they're all as the Sanderson sisters or something like that. Yeah. And then there's a fair few Toy Story and there like Woody and Buzz and whatnot. And I did see a Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head. That's quite cool. I've seen quite a few good ones and I was telling Claire at one of the parties a few years ago, someone had a very very tiny baby who had natural red curly hair who was Winnie and the mom and dad were um the other Sanderson sisters. The dad had like a blonde wig and Sarah Jessica Parker character. It was so funny. So you do see a lot of it's actually cool to see people's costumes. People really make an effort, don't they? Really really make an effort. So it is overall it is a very different experience. It's not like a normal day in the Magic Kingdom, but it doesn't get going till 7:00. That's really when you'll notice a difference, but if you've never done it before, I would try it if you can because it's something very different. If you've done it, if you've done it before, maybe do it every two or three visits um just to really then appreciate it when you do it again, yeah, that would be my take away from it. So, we are going to probably now maybe brave the buses cuz it looks like everything's clearing. Cla's exhausted. We are also a tiny bit hungry because it's been a long time since our Bristol Palace. So, we made We ate We had our book in there at 3. Yeah. And all I've had is a few like baby Twixes and Skittles. Yeah. And I had my my beignet. So, I didn't have pudding at Crystal Palace. No. And I only ate two out of the three beignets cuz they were just okay. So, we might get ourselves an Uber Eats while we're on the bus and then we can meet them at the lobby and take it back to the room cuz I could do with a drink as well. So, and luckily in Orlando, everything is always open. You can always get Uber Eats. Where I live in deep as dark as Somerset, you can't even get a takeaway in the day half the time or in a normal time of night. So, uh that's a bit of a novelty for me to be able to do that. But yeah, it's been an amazing night. I hope you guys have enjoyed this vlog. If you have, please do give it a thumbs up. It helps other people to find it. And we love doing these events. Everything that we do in the parks, to be honest, just going to the parks on a day-to-day basis. Do you know what other thing I loved about today? Oh, yeah. is the Booty You song. Yeah, I love that song. I love it. I love that's going to be in my head all night. That song has been going since I first started coming 16 years ago. So, I love it. I love it. I do love it. So, it's been really amazing and we just love doing these things ourselves, but obviously sharing it with you guys and vlogging it for you and meeting all of you. Yes, we met loads of you tonight again as well and we just love it. Do subscribe if you haven't already because as well as all of these vlogs, it is then going to run right into the November vlogs with Paul. So, there's so much to come all the way till the end of this year. And we're just loving it, aren't we? Yeah. We love it. We love it so much. So, thank you guys so much for watching and taking the time out of your day. We are going to see you in the next one next Saturday, which will be us resort hopping. Yes. Going around the resorts. We're doing Grand Vidian, Art of Animation, and Pop Century. We're also going to Coronado Springs and Three Bridges. And in the next one is going to be the Starlight Parade here in the Magic Kingdom. We are buzzing. We can't wait. So excited for that. So, we'll see you next Saturday for that one. Bye. [Music] [Music]"

Thank you so much cuz we had our king bed and our tub and all the fun things that come along with a onebedroom. So I am really looking forward to this. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I know. It looks really good. Hi. Good morning, you guys, and welcome to our Disney travel day. I am so excited. We are getting ready to walk out of the house. It is 3:56 in the morning. And we got up at 3:30, so we got ready pretty quickly. The just finishing up in the bathroom and then we're going to hit the door. We've got to leave by 4:00, so we got 4 minutes. But I feel like we're we're doing we're on track. This is our adult only trip. This is for my birthday actually cuz we talked about it and we're like, let's go by just by ourselves cuz we've not done that in a year. And for us, like I can't believe we've started doing this. Our very first couple's trip. This was one of those things I'm like I don't know if this will stick and it's been great. Like we love it and it's so nice getting to connect and spend time together. So we are flying down for two nights which is our max. We're like that is about it as far as like time we can be away from our babies. So that's kind of usually our our go-to is a little twoight trip. But we're flying down staying at Sarah's Toga Springs. We are DVC use or DVC owners. So, we're it's early, you guys. Words are hard right now. So, we are using our points snagged us a two-bedroom villa at our home resort, which we are so excited about. I'm like, we get a tub, which is so fun. Um, and then all the other space. We get a king bed. I'm like, this is going to be amazing. I'm so excited. But we better get in the car and head to the airport. We don't have a lot of loose plans. I just have a loose birthday to-do list of like things I would like to do at Disney and just chill. So, these may be a little more laidback. We've been like pretty go with work and stuff lately. So, we're both like we're just we're ready to chill. So, this is going to be a little bit more relaxing. But, let's go to Disney. [Music] [Music] That's all. [Music] Okay, I've never been on one of these moving walkways. Our airport's just never been big enough, but apparently now we're big enough to have a moving walkway. So, here we are. We bi I almost tripped cuz I was like stepping so high cuz I expected it to be like an escalator. Not an escalator. Definitely not an escalator. All right, you guys. We literally walked past Prince's Hot Chicken, which if you're from Nashville is the superior hot chicken. I'm going to be perfectly honest. But or if you come, that's the one you should try. It's the best. But he's like, \"No, I think it's too early for hot chicken.\" And I'm like, \"Oh, their chicken's really good.\" Like, we could get some. They're open. He's like, \"No, I don't think so.\" We get over here. This joker's like, \"I'm going to go get a croissant.\" I went to go get a croissant. I found a panini and they had the Nashville. It's got some hot chicken in there. It's got some cheese. It's got some honey. It looks so good. Good thing I brought my Cheetos. [Music] When you're near. [Music] [Applause] So somehow we ended up with exit row seats. I saw them available. We were boarding the plane and the flight attendant was like sitting in this row like welcoming people aboard and I'm like, \"Oh, hey, are these open?\" This is never an option cuz we fly with the kids all the time. I'm like, but I feel like we just got up upgraded to first class. We got so much. This is crazy. This I really like. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] When you need money, [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] All right. Welcome to the South. Thank you so much. [Music] [Music] [Applause] This is so soft. Oh my gosh, it's the Saratoga Springs version of the Riviera mug that I got. I love it. $19.99. Okay, we may have to have one for our home resort. [Music] We're going to reach [Music] Sanitiz. How cute will I look with that bag in my hand? You'd never look better. I'll take it. You're a vision washing walking over with those sandwiches. Okay, I'll bet. All right, let's see. What are we doing? Trying to figure out which one's which without opening it. Oh, okay. Now, this is definitely yours. The sticker literally says it on it. Oh, it was definitely a way more fun way to to tell what sandwich was which. So, you know, I got it right. You did. You got it right. I thought you said that was mine. And I was like, \"Oh, man.\" No, I was kidding. I got a nose. Oh, I love my holiday turkey. I'm so glad this is here year round. It's like Christmas and Thanksgiving under a one happy little bun. Brisket. Do I need to do a little juicy thing? Jeez. Oh, so good. Squeeze. It just tastes cozy. That's so good. first floor of the paddock building. So, let me look at the map. Is that one right over here? Uh, no. It's just across from Congress, which is where we usually stayed. We're in the building right next to Carousel. We could have already had our room. You know, we have a hotel. It's nice. We got our room. It's 11:40 basically and we already have our room. So, that's pretty nice knowing. That is very nice. All [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] right, we We have made it to our room. I'm so excited. All checked in. And before lunch, like before, what was it? 12:00 officially. We had our room text, which is awesome. I will take an early room. It's not quite in the building. I wasn't open before. It was hoping for a little closer to Disney Springs, but that's okay. I am happy to be here. We're in our onebedroom, which I am so so excited about. So, cuz we had our king bed and our tub and all the fun things that come along with a onebedroom. So, I am really looking forward to this. But, ooh, I did think it's We're going to take a nap. Okay, watch this. I do love our view, though. This is beautiful. Gorgeous view. Hold on. All right, there we go. Gorgeous view. And you see that building over there? That's where we can get our cupcake. Ooh, true. Very true. Okay, I'm excited. But seriously though, I'm not joking about that nap. I'm like, the more I was sitting there and eating lunch, I'm like, I'm getting sleepier by the second. kind of got a little energy walking into the room and stuff, but I'm like, \"Okay, we need we we should take a nap.\" And we can take a nap and we don't have to be like, \"Kids, go to sleep. Stop talking. Stop rolling around. You have to take a nap.\" We can just take a nap cuz we want to take a nap. But then we're also like every other breath is like, \"I miss the girls. They would love this. Look at that little kid that reminds us of ours.\" I'm like, \"Yeah.\" Yeah. We go and we're like, \"Look at this beautiful thing.\" Basically, we did walk through the art store after Tammy. We were in our Sammy coma. We walk through Launchpad McQuack. Nice to go with Darkling Duck and Gizmo and Moi. Oh, that's not Moi. Figaro. And it's a purple Figaro. Purple Figaro. We have a little girl who loves kitties and the color purple. So, we got that for our collection. So, we like slowly we're very picky about our sketches. Like we look through every single time we're right near any of them, but we're always like, I don't know. I'm not so sure. And then like when we see one that we're like, this is the one and we add to the collection like that, too. I would love to put them up in like our office or something. I think that would be cool. But we're going to take a nap and then we're going to go have some more fun. I'm like, we're just going to enjoy being adult only. This is some of you probably like this is so boring. Listen, it's my birthday weekend and I am having a blast. Thank you very much. So, I'll see you guys postnap. We're out postnap. That felt good. 2 hours. There was one point I woke up and I'm like I could wake up or I could go back to back to sleep. He was still knocked out and I'm like I'm going back to sleep. That answers that question. So, it's like what? 4:30 in the afternoon. Yeah. Well, it's 4:56 now after 456. Yeah. We got ready and got out the door. Um, we're going to walk over to Disney Springs cuz that's just what we do when we stay here. This was our very first resort that we ever stayed at at Disney with Saratoga Springs in a one-bedroom for our honeymoon. And so, we like were instantly spoiled straight out the gate. Um, and we were in Congress Park and so we could literally take what wasn't the walking path. There was no walking path at the time. It was literally walking kind of kind of on the side of the street a little bit. Um, but there was a bridge sort of kind of to get there. But we would literally walk over and go enjoy Disney Springs and hang out over there and go to the parks and do all the things that you do. And it was so fun. So, it's just kind of a bridge. It was you would walk up to the main road and then there was a bridge that the cars walked across and there was a there was a sidewalk. Yeah. So it was there was a sidewalk. Yeah. We weren't like in the street. I promise. No. [Applause] [Laughter] But needless to say, it's just kind of our thing. So we're like, let's walk to Disney Springs. So we're going to walk over there. I one of the things on my birthday checklist is to get a Gideon's cookie butter iced coffee. And that is what she we shall do. I want a peanut butter ice coffee. Let's It's 5:00 in the evening. Let's go get coffee. Why not? It's Disney. [Music] [Applause] [Music] So this is the path. It would keep going and it winds around the curve and then you would walk on the sidewalk along the road. Then that's the bridge we were talking about crossing over there. And that's how we would get to Disney Springs. Also, our room was like right at the end. So, we could literally walk out our door, walk down the stairwell, and we were right here. So, it was like the most convenient placement ever. It'd be even better now. I know it would. It's literally that that spot is golden now. So good. Like we we enjoyed it then, but yeah, it's extra good. I want to come back next year and bring the girls. And I want to stay here cuz it's been so long since we stayed here. I don't know. No, it was after our wish cruise. What? Two, three years ago. Sick. And so it was come here sleep until the next day. Yep. Yep. That m that miserable day. That's why I kind of don't count that one. That was terrible. It was so bad. It was Yeah, that was a rough day. That almost ruined Disney cruises for us. And it was the very first one. [Music] We found Dean's souvenir. It's a pullover. He's a dieh hard bar fan. You need it. That's epic. If they had a Sammy, I would get it and we could be like split. I love the embroidered Mickey on the sleeve. And this is fuzzy. Okay, we need to look at a another large cuz like this one's got some pulling. They do. There's one in the back. And then this has like some sticky to it. But seriously, your hand sticky when you eat these. Yeah, that's the reason I'm sure. So cute. Yeah, this one doesn't have any damage. It's allergic. It's allergic. All right. I know my size. It got me. [Music] I can smell the hot chocolate right now. Girardelli, I know. I can't tell. It smells so good. Gerard Deli smells fantastic. They make an amazing hot chocolate. They really do. It's so rich. I love it. [Music] I watch you as you drive. This one's a muscle soother. I know. I saw that when we came in. It looked good. Is it after a long Disney day? That sounds really good. [Music] Is delicious. Yum. That's a Mickey. I'll get one for tonight, one for tomorrow night, and then one to take home with I like this one. A eucalyptus, peppermint, and clean musk. That one. Bath bombs acquired. That was another thing. Checked off the birthday to-do list. We're staying at a place in the tub and now we have the bath bombs. We got bath bombs. We're golden. I'm so excited. Like way too excited about those. Now, let's go get that coffee. Later and later. It's only 5:42 only. On only That's a line. That's a long line. It's already 5:48. You can have it back. Decisions. Decision. Look, I'm here for it. If you're here for it, I'm here for it. Like, I want to be here for it, but I kind of don't want to be here for it. We can always be here for it the day we leave. Trail. Mhm. Valid point. Okay, let's do it. Okay, we're going to check that one off the list later. Time it right. It's 6 and if we're out by 8, we might can get hot cookie hour and get lover. [Music] I'm loving this moment. Can we stay here forever? All right. So, we called the game time decision. I'm like, it's going to take a lot of time to go to Polly and then be able to get in at Tamboo potentially. It is Saturday night, so I'm like, I don't know. Don't feel like fighting that crowd. And also, we want to get up early in the morning to go to the park. So, I'm trying to think ahead. Oh, yeah. Cuz we are going to be up early cuz we are early rope droppers. We We are early people. So, we've got on the wait list for Summerhouse. We enjoyed our breakfast there, so we're going to go try dinner. It looks fantastic. My thing is I'm going to have a hard time picking what to get cuz there's so much on their menu. And it's all so good. Everything we had there was good. I Yeah, I enjoyed everything that we had and so I'm excited to try dinner. Um, so yeah, we've just got a few minutes to kill. Like it could take up to 30 minutes. We'll see. I don't know. It just doesn't feel that busy, but I could be wrong. So, we're gonna just walk around and enjoy the sights of Disney Springs. [Music] Come [Music] on. Come on. [Music] Are you going to get the Wagu steak taco? Yep. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I know. It looks really good. Hi. Okay. So, one of my favorite things that I started doing if I'm looking up something is I will or trying to figure out what to eat and I'm like, I wonder what this actually looks like to give like kind of kind of a representation is I will type it into Google like that's the riotoni I'm looking at. So, I'll just type in the name of the food like the entree and then I'll type in the name of the restaurant. And I don't know if anybody else is weird like that and you're like, I want to see this. I just think it's helpful. [Music] All right, the Parmesan truffle fries had arrived. Get in my belly. in my belly. Are they good? I like that. They look fantastic. [Music] These are good, but they're not as good as those fries from Toalenos that night. Oh, yes. Those were those I don't know what they did with that. Those were magical. These are good. Those were magical. They are nice and seasoned, though. Oh my goodness. Dinner has arrived. This steak wagu steak tacos. They look fantastic. They look amazing. I'm a man. Oh, it's good. And then I got the rigy rig pony alla vodka and I added protein. You could add the steak to that as well. So, I did. Looks awesome. I am so excited to dive in. Also, I love this bowl. It's so pretty. Okay, the pasta is good. You want a bite? I do. It's got a little bit of spice to it. Oh, I like that. Just a little bit. I like that. All right. The steak is so tender. I could cut it with my butter knife. That's good. I like that a lot. [Music] What do you think? Worth every penny. It's so good. I just need I need hot sauce. Do you have any hot sauce? Cholula and Tabasco. Cholula. Anything else here for you? I don't think so. Thank you. Sprite. Uh, sure. That' be great. Enjoy. You right there. Let's go. So, we finished dinner and we are booking it to Gideon's. Even though we're stuffed, we're not too stuffed for hot cookie hour. And we're hoping we can make it cuz it ends in 40 minutes. So, we'll see. We're helping him. He doesn't feel as bad. Hot cookie has been acquired. We're going to go find a spot to enjoy it. [Music] We know I've wanted the Gideon's coffee. And I'm like, I'd really like to have it more than twice. So, we got them. I know what you're thinking, Ashley. It's 8:00 at night. Why the heck are you drinking coffee? I'm not. Don't worry. The straws are still in the sleeves. We're not doing that. We order them without ice. And I think this may be my new favorite thing. This This may become part of the routine. It's like if you're Disney Springs at night, order it without the ice. Take it back, put it in your fridge, and enjoy it the next morning. As soon as you wake up, you could add some ice in it from the ice machine at your hotel. If you are in a onebedroom like us, then we'll should have ice and the ice maker in the fridge. I'm excited. I'm pumped. And look, it's going to be so good. I ain't going to lie. I'm not trying to be that guy. But they do give you a lot more. You do. You get a lot. So like if you're like, I want to get my money's worth. That's also a way to get your money's worth. There you go. So just saying I'm excited. Ain't going to mess with your sleep. I can taste it already. The ice cream's hard in the cookie. It's not a hot cookie anymore. [Music] Wow. [Music]"

      "transcript": "It's time for one last coffee on the porch. Today is checkout day. It is 8:46 in the morning, so we're just enjoying our coffee, slowly packing up. I'm getting ready to leave, but wanted to do kind of final thoughts. We have spent two weeks here in the cabin. So, we've definitely got some thoughts about it of whether we would do it again, who we think it's good for, and we want to kind of talk about the four topics just like as a little recap here at the end. Um, so definitely wanted to talk about transportation first because I feel like that is the big deterrent for a lot of people staying here is dealing with transportation. Um, do you want to share what you thought about it? All right. My thought is, um, it's not that bad. I I was surprised actually. Um, so same. One cool thing is that you can drive if you want to drive. We're early risers to go to the parks. And so whenever we would get up early for our rope drop and we would drive, we we would get really close parking that was basically the same distance as walking to a bus stop. Yeah. So, they moved really well throughout the resort here. Um, yeah, I think the longest we probably waited was last night coming back from the campfire and waited 15. Yeah, maybe. Yeah, maybe 15. 10 to 15. I feel like I didn't like stopwatch it, but it didn't like it felt longer than others, but it wasn't forever. So, so it was good. And then like the um going to Magic Kingdom on the boat. That's very nice. It's super cool. And it was right on time. So, if you are a rope drop comp company, a rope drop family, you can go to the the dock and expect to be picked up right when they're supposed to start. So, yeah. which is it's an hour before uh opening. They pull up 1 hour before. Yeah. So we were there 1 hour before early entry. Um so that would have been for us on that day it would have been 7:30. We like to get there a little bit early. That way we can go ahead grab a coffee and have our photo in front of the castle. You have to deal with going through security. You have to actually ride the boat there. So we're not like first ones there at the gates like waiting to tap in. But we do like to get there a couple minutes before because I feel like that way you can actually maximize that 30 minutes because it goes really fast. Um, so once we can start getting on attractions, we want to be there just a couple minutes before that. So we're not crazy early, but we do we do like to be there a just a little bit before. Um, but yeah, I've would have to just echo everything you said cuz literally I've I've not heard great things about it and it being a resort with multiple bus stops throughout and staying at other resorts like Riverside or Caribbean Beach or things like that, even larger resorts or our home resort Saratoga. Um, I almost feel like the bus service here was better, even though you did have to change you do have to change buses at the outpost. And also, this is how I was able to remember it. So, I wanted to share this, too, is the outpost is how you get out of here. So, if you're going to a park that is Epcot, Hollywood Studios, Animal Kingdom, Disney Springs, or one of the water parks, you're going to want to go to the outpost so you can get out of here. If you're needing dining and something that's here, go to the settlement. I'm sure Disney thought of this. And I'm like, \"Oh, that's why they named it the things that they did.\" And then the meadow is in the middle and that is what has your pool and the campfire, all that good stuff. Kaying, uh, kayaking. The bike bike barn is there if you want to rent bikes, if you want to rent kayaks, if you want to do um fishing, if you want to rent fishing gear and fish there, you can do that sort of thing. Um, but yeah, I feel like it went really, really well. Um, based on the transportation, I don't know that we would have enjoyed it quite as much if we didn't have a vehicle. Yeah, I like I liked having a car for going to the parks other than the Magic Kingdom. Yes, other than Magic Kingdom, we would get on the bus and then go to the boat and then get on that mode of transportation. And when we went to Disney Springs, we took the bus to the place and we switched and we did that a couple times to places. Animal Kingdom and Lucy, it wasn't so bad either. It's not bad. It's not bad. I just feel like if you're if you don't like Disney buses or you dread transportation and that is just like the bane of your existence and it stresses you, this ultimately is not going to be a good option for you. Unless you are bringing your own personal vehicle. Um, you're still going to have to use transportation because there's no parking at the settlement. So, you can't drive to the quick service, you can't drive to hoop-de-doo, you cannot drive to the pool, none of that. So, you are going to have to get on transportation unless you rent the golf cart. And the golf cart again is $75 a day. So, um the transportation wasn't bad, but if you hate transportation, Yeah. this is not your resort. No. And one of the one of the things you got to do with a transportation is if if you have a stroller, you have to know your stroller. know how to take it apart, have your go bag where you can throw everything out, make know how to fold it up and just get on because we're good at that. It makes it to me it's it's a non-issue. Yeah. I don't mind getting on a bus. It doesn't hurt my feelings. No offense, guys. I have a Disney dad pro over here. So, and that's not a dis towards any other dads, but it's like having ultimately transportation, your mindset really matters. And so if you can try to if you can try to flip into that mindset of it's okay, I can be tough. I can do this for a few minutes. It is what it is. And you're like, I'm just going to fold the stroller. Like it's not hard. You just fold the stroller and you just do it. It It makes it a lot easier. Mindset really matters. Um okay, other part is the cabin itself. So what you're paying to stay in. Um I really like it. The only thing that I wish it would have is a washer and dryer. Like that's the only thing this place is missing and it would make it absolutely incredible. Like it's already amazing, but it would just push it over the top for me. I'm like if they could have just like slid the kitchen in just a little bit or like consolidated that just a little bit in between the kitchen the like into the cabinet and where the um bed the Murphy bed folds down. If they could have just put a stackable unit right there, like that would have been amazing. I think it would have been great. Um, I like doing laundry especially like we're here in August, you guys. We are sweating like sinners in church, okay? It is pouring like you walk outside and you just like it's you just feel sweat pouring off of you. You're going to the pool, you have to bring here at the at the pools at Fort Wilderness, you do have to bring your own towels. So, you've got like your own beach towels that you're having to deal with. So, and especially if you are staying here on DBC points, you're not going to have housekeeping on on all those things. So, if you wanted to even wash your own bedding, like not that most people want to do that on vacation, but if you wanted to, if you had an incident and you're like, I just want to wash the sheets or whatever, then you could do that and that would be really nice. Um, but I feel like that's the only thing that's missing. The kids love the bunk beds. They were very comfortable. All the beds slept great. Um, we loved all of being as a family. Our girls love the fact that the bunk beds and our bed were in the same room. I'm like, this is like any other hotel room. But for them, it felt extra special. So, loved that. Loved having the full kitchen. Um, it is like the stove and things are a little bit bigger than it used to be. So, that's really nice. Um, yeah. I didn't know a lot. Yeah, I didn't know how I would feel about the bathroom being split from the bedroom. Like, it's on the opposite side of the cabin. And after some time, I'm like, \"This is great.\" What did you think of the cabin? You liked it. What was your favorite part of the cabin? Can you tell us? Bunk beds. The bunk beds. Yeah. But yeah, ultimately I think the cabin is great. I love the renovation. I love that it's still kind of It has that tiny home feel almost. It has the cabinish feel. It's not like super log cabiny, but it still does have that feel. It's very relaxing here. It's very peaceful. Um, if you're looking for a laid-back, relaxing resort, this is definitely It's definitely laidback. Definitely laidback and relaxing. Um, honestly, for me, I would 100% pick this over Wilderness Lodge. Like, if we comparing the two, like, I love this. Like, the feel it's just it's unlike any other Disney resort. And I just I love that. I love that you can come here and it doesn't even feel like you're on property. Like super cool. If you have people in your party that they're like, I want to do some not less Disney stuff, like this is the place. Yeah, I like this. I like the whole thing. The the cabin's amazing. I like the bathroom. The way it's set up with the extra bathroom outside or the the sink outside so in the bathroom or taking a shower, you can still brush your teeth and you can get ready for the day if you need to. It's awesome. Um, full kitchen. We use it a lot. Uh even if you just want to make some eggs cuz it's late at night and you're like, \"Man, I could really go for some eggs.\" Uh yeah, Lucy at one point, she was just like, \"Hey, I need some eggs.\" Okay, I got you. Let me make some eggs. And then we just kept making like six eggs. She just You guys were hungry. I'm a little bottommost pit. Yeah, it was awesome. But the room the room layout's good and the bunk beds were were nice. Um, yeah. I mean, I wouldn't want to have bunk beds in my personal home, but for vacation is pretty cool. No, we're not moving in for like eternity. Um, but yeah. Okay. Amenities. What do you think about the pool, Dean? I mean, it's about the worst pool. It's not great. It's The splash pad is awesome. Splash pad. Fantastic. I think the splash pad is one of the best on property. I would put it up next to the Polynesian splash pad. It does not have a giant dumping bucket. And so if your kids hate dumping buckets like the one at Gridian, if you've ever seen that one, whether you stay there or walking by and it's like big the big giant hat and it's like gallons and gallons of water just like crashing down on you. Um my kids don't care for that at all. Um, so they don't like to feel like they're drowning standing up. No. Um, I don't know who thought that was a good idea for for small children. Allstar Music has a more enjoyable pool. Like really. Okay. I like I think that one's way cooler. This one is just a It's like a quiet pool in a funny shape with a slide. Like it's nothing special. It's nothing. This is small. Yeah. It's just a little Yeah. It's It's very small. It's not not super thrilling. Yeah. Um but most of the most of the moderate pools aren't super thrilling. Yeah. Well, there's not a zero entry here. And maybe if it was a zero entry, it would be better. That would have been nice because that's what the girls really need to have like a great time. They they ended up even with little kids. Yeah. If you have little kids that are like baby toddler age, then that's really helpful. They're not like climbing in and out of a pool. So, that's helpful. Um it's not bad. It is a great place to cool off. I'm not complaining about having a pool, but as far as pools go and like rating them against every other Disney resort, I like the hot tub. There's a hot tub. They do have a hot tub at both pools pool and the main. So, the wilderness pool, which is the one that's closest to the cabins, and then you have the um meadow pool, that's the main pool. And um yeah, that one it's it's good. It's a great place to cool off, but it's not anything just it's not special to write home about. Yeah, I really care. Um, activities are great. They've got lots of activities here. I love that you can do the fishing. I love that you can do um renting a kayak and a canoe. You can do horseback rides. You can go to the barn and do pony rides with the kids. There are there's so much to do. Pony rides are awesome. Yeah, the girls love it. And Lucy and Bella both got their first pony ride on the back of Dolly and they're very excited about that. Oh yeah. Lucy rode Dolly for the first time and then when we came back they gave Bella Dolly. Like we didn't ask her anything and so like Dolly is our family's honorary first pony pony ride. I think I think that's sweet. I think it's a nice little tradition but it's like they they rode Dolly. Um all right. Anything else activities wise? There's a lot of activities around here. Most of them cost an extra dollars, but it's it's one of the you can go kaying. I think they have archery. They've got bike riding. They do. I forgot about the archery. And then obviously you have the best campfire on on property like of all the like s'mores roast campfire situations. That one's the best cuz you got to sing along with Chip and Dale. So that's pretty fun. That one is and you and again, I know I said this last night, but you do not have to be staying here for that. So even if you don't stay here, you can come here and do that. So, you could go to Magic Kingdom, take the boat from from Magic Kingdom to Fort Wilderness, come over that way. Um, with the Disney resorts, I believe it's this way for moderates. I know for sure it's for this way for Deluxe. Um, but I am 99.9% sure that you can't just drive here. So, you couldn't come and park and then take the bus back to the campfire. Um, just for the reason you wouldn't have a reservation. So, if you come and you do hoopt and then you did that, then you could park here. if you're driving or um you could have a minivan bring you here, an Uber, something like that. And last but not least, we got to talk about dining. It's delicious. It is and nutritious. We got brisket. It was good. It I reheated it and I made some eggs with it. I had eggs and brisket for dinner last night. It was delightful. It's expensive. It was like 20 bucks for brisket, but yeah, it was 20 $1 199.99 for a pound. So, it's pretty good. I mean, it's it's not for Disney prices. Honestly, it's not terrible. I love that you can get you can get the giant pizzas here for I think it was $22 now. Um, so like as a family meals for economical family meals, the quick service is fantastic. They do have the family meals that you can get for the chicken. It's just under $30. I think it was like 28 in that range. So, under 30 bucks, you can feed your family. Like for us, our family of four ate the eightpiece chicken and it comes with two sides. Oh, those are so good, too. We got mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. You can do the cowboy beans. Literally, it's almost everything that you can get at Hoop-doo, but there cuz it's all coming out of the same kitchen. So, like if you're going to Hoopdoo and you're like, \"Man, this food was good.\" Just go to just go to Trails End. It's the same food. It's good. Um, I think that's what caught me off guard with going to Hoop-doo is I was expecting something different and something elevated and it's like, \"Oh, I just paid for the show.\" Yep. Okay. That That's kind of what threw me off. Like, it was cute. It was good. Like, I'm not anti- Hoopt. Um, it's not something that I'm going to be like, \"Oh, I got to do this every time we come to Disney World.\" It was good, though, and it was cute. Um, it's probably the most celebratory place to have a birthday or an anniversary. Oh, yeah. That was cute. They make the biggest deal out of it. So, if you're coming for that and you want a big deal made about your birthday, that's the place to go. Posting you a song. They will. It is a a whole thing. Um, but as far as food goes, I think it's great. I think the quick service is great. It's located right next to the playground. So on a midday when it's not a scorcher, honestly, I would say it could even be worth leaving Magic Kingdom to come over here, eat it, eat lunch at Trails In, let the kids play on the playground, and then go back if you're wanting like a nonap midday break kind of thing. Well, it doesn't taste like you're eating park food. You're like they're real mashed potatoes and it's real macaroni. Those two things were just out of this world delicious. Yes. Like you can taste that it's like real potatoes. We're not talking like instant fluffy potatoes like they serve you in the castle when you go to Chris or when you go to Cinderella's royal table. No, these were legit. They even had uh go down road. But yes, they're very good. Very real food, which is is nice. The chicken obviously is fried, but they do have a baked option. So, if you want baked and you're wanting less fried, less greasy, if you're needing something that you're like, I am tired of greasy food, then you also have that as an option. All right. So, is that is that our four categories? I think so. Um, ultimately, I feel like this is a great resort if you can get past the transportation. Yeah. And that doesn't bother you. This is an incredible resort and it feels like a vacation outside of a vacation. Yeah, especially if you're somebody that's like, \"Let's slow down a little bit, too.\" Like, this is this is really a vacation spot because we've got to sit out on the porch and enjoy coffee and yes, there's people driving around in golf carts cleaning stuff up and that's fine, but yeah. And other guests and stuff, but everybody's so friendly and they're just like howdy and like waving and it is like so friendly and it's just it's really cute. Like it's really cute. Honestly, this would even be a great like cap to a trip where you spend a night or two here, you rent the golf cart, and you like wind down after your Disney vacation. This is a great spot to do that. I feel like especially if you're like we are where you're like you're we're park people. Like if we're here at Disney, we're going to be in the park. We walked over a 100 miles in the last two weeks and so it's pretty nice for us to be able to sit down and like Yeah. So that that's what yesterday and today have been for us is our like last day enjoy the resort to like do some of the things here. And yeah, I I think it's a great resort. Again, if you can just get past the transportation, I think that's the biggest hangup for so many people. But I thought it was great. I loved it. I'd do it again. I definitely would. Man, if you're bringing like grandparents that are just like, I don't want to go to the park, but I'd like to look out and see some birds. This would be a good spot to look out and see some birds. It is. It really is. Or if you're doing multiple families, like multiple people having cabins and stuff. Oh, I've seen that. Like couple families are like privacy, but then you can like all congregate and have dinner and Yeah, I like it. All right, that's going to do it for our resort day days review.

      "transcript": "I I take me home today. Take me out to play. Take me back into sweet sweet. Good morning from Allstar Sports and we are off to Animal Kingdom today. I've got my lemon dress on. My mom actually made this one and these ears are from Magic Maker ears. They are perfect with this. I will link them below. Thank you for sending them to me. And today we are going to be meeting up with Becky this morning and her husband. So that'll be really nice. We're going to go for a coffee at Nomad Lounge. I don't think you've ever been in Nomad Lounge before. No, I've been to Tiffens. That was back in 2018, though. So yeah, I have been there. It's It was really good, actually. I enjoyed it. But yeah, so I but I've never actually been in Nomad Lounge. Yeah, it's good. is a really good place to stop in Animal Kingdom. We're going to be riding Flight of Passage, doing the safari, Lion King show, general Animal Kingdom wandering, which I absolutely love. And as I mentioned in the previous vlog, this evening, we're going to be going to Disney Springs. We're going to be making a candle, a Bose signature candles. I am so excited about that cuz I love the Bose candles. I like I have used the one that I've had so much I keep on reusing it and I I just need more. I also use the hand cream from Bose. Like I love that cuz I I get to smell like the resorts. They do loads of different resort fragrances and they do the candle making class where you can create your own and they've got their autumn fragrances. So that's what we're going to be doing today. Music and bubbles. [Applause] I do love the music they have in the mornings here. It's cool. I think this is on like Trolls or something. I know it's not Disney, but I think it is. [Music] We were just laughing at my TARDIS bag. This mini bag is like a tiny little cross body, but it's like a double bag. And honestly, I've got in here the umbrella, tripod, phone mount, extra like chargers, power bank, all my makeup, my like it is all in here. This bag just swallows up a crazy amount of stuff. I got it ages ago from Primark. A lot of you guys ask about this bag, but I don't think you can get it now. Oh, this music. I love this. Got beautiful blue skies today, which is what we love. [Music] Hello everyone. and welcome to Kiljaro Safari. Remain fully seated the entire time, keeping those hands, arms, feet, and legs inside the vehicle as well. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] That was so good. It was very long though. So, we queued about 40 minutes, maybe just over. It said 30 when we first got there, but it was actually about 40. Yeah, it was about 40 minutes. And then when we were on the attraction, it was over 30 minutes because we had a lot of stopping. There were ostriches in the road, giraffes crossing, but it's very cool because you get to see them then more close up. But yeah, we did stop quite a lot. So overall, it actually took an hour and 10 probably to do that. So just allow time when you're doing the safari cuz that can happen. But it's great. Although that is the longest I've ever had to queue to go on the ride. Yeah, it was quite long. I've never ever had to queue for that long. But it just is what it is though. It's so good. It's one of the best thing you there's no way you can come to Animal Kingdom and not do the safari. We're taking this route to Flight of Passage because when you come from the safari, if you go this back way, it generally is a little bit less busy unless the Lion King show is just finished and then it is crazy. And don't come this way. But generally, um, this actually is better. It takes like the back entrance into Pandora. Oh, it always smells so good coming from Satuli Canteen. What I'll do maybe when we're back later, hopefully I'll remember to do it in this vlog. If not, I'll do it in one of the future ones. I'll let you know what we paid for each of these lightning lanes and for the multipass in the Magic Kingdom. I think we also did a multipass for Hollywood Studios if I remember correctly. Yeah, we did. We did. Yeah. So, I'll let you know the prices of all of those cuz it's just worth knowing and whether we thought it was worth it and all of that kind of thing. Welcome to the Avatar program. Soon you're going to have a chance to undertake an amazing Na'vi ride of passage, flying on the back of this powerful animal called an erron, or as we call it, a banshee. Absolutely loved that as always. Will forever be one of my favorites. It doesn't matter what else comes along. Flight of Passage is just incredible. It's um it's literally like nothing else there, is it? I know there's other 3D rides, but not like that. No, not like that. It's incredible. Absolutely loved it. And now we are off to Nomad Lounge to meet Becky. And I am really looking forward to your coffee. We are so thirsty. We are. It's like 10 to 12. Have you even sipped anything yet? Literally nothing. I had some water back at the room before we left. I did have I did have something at the room, but not since we left the room. Yeah, I haven't had anything. So, we're really thirsty. We just haven't had time. Hi. I know you guys would not forgive me if I didn't get to say hi. We obviously ate churros because having a good time. Yes. Fantastic. You got a few days left? Yeah, only a few more left. Yeah, we're only here for a week, but it's been great so far. Sometimes you just need a little spontaneous week. Vitamin D political reason. But you'll see Becky again in live streams and do those with me, so you'll see again. It's nice to see you in Disney. Bye everyone. That was so great being in Nomad Lounge and getting to see Becky and her husband. We had nice little coffee and churros and everything. I will put in a clip. I did take a clip of the coffee and churros. If you have never done that, do it. The churros at Nomad Lounge are honestly next level good. They're so amazing. and I just had a couple of things to do there. So, I'm just looking for Claire now. And I met some lovely subscribers there. I have met so many of you guys this morning. I think Animal Kingdom is the place to be today. So, to everyone who's come up and said hello, I love chatting to you. Thank you so much. We spoke to another lovely couple earlier. Um, yeah, we just love talking to you. It's amazing. And also, wouldn't it be good to see Kevin? I feel like Kevin has evaded us the last two or three trips. I haven't seen her for so long. So, listen out for Kevin. You know the sound. If you know, you know. I'm just in Discovery Trading looking for Claire and I stumbled into the annual passholder magnet distribution. So, I got this one. This is so cute. I've got several of these from over the years. They do give these away fairly regularly. Why do I always end up immediately in the mug section? I've seen these ones everywhere. These are obviously a new range. Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy. And these are the Animal Kingdom specific ones. There's this one, which is like a really interesting color. I would say that's like a bronze. Almost looks a bit purpley on camera. And then this one they have had for a while. That's really nice. There's also a zebra one. These seem to be quite popular at the moment. It's almost like a Stanley Cup style thing. And you've got a purse attached to it. And I guess you could fit like, you know, cards, a bit of money, and stuff in there. Not much though. It's pretty small. You can fit maybe headphones in there as well. Look at this Mickey Halloween tea. I haven't seen this before. Mickey's got one of those like skeleton onesies on. And they have this Animal Kingdom t-shirt. That's really nice. And we've got four vibes there. So far, so good. This PopSocket is nice. It's like a really smooth kind of rubbery finish to it rather than shiny. And I feel like although this type of thing can sometimes get a bit dirty, it will clean up, but it doesn't get scratched in the same way. Is this PopSocket brand then? Yes, it is. I am kind of tempted by this. They also have Winnie the Pooh, but he's like plushy. I don't think I've ever seen a plushy PopSocket before. Think I might treat myself to that. If you saw the Target vlog, you will see that we were looking at the Popsockets. And actually, this one is around the same price, like $35, but because I get my annual pass discount, then it will make it a little bit cheaper. So, that will actually definitely be cheaper than these cost in the UK for the Popsocket branded ones. And we've got a Halloween spirit jersey. Got Goofy there as a scarecrow. Minnie and Mickey, Pluto, Chip and Dale, Donald and Daisy. That's really neat, actually. That's what the front looks like. Look at this mini ghost. That's really neat. It lights up. I wonder if it changes color if it's just pink. It looks good when it's not lit up. I still love this anxiety clipon for your bag. It's like a bag charm type thing. Look at this scar headband. That's funny. I should mention as well that I did charge the magic band last night according to the instructions from the lady at guest relations at Epcot and it's now working. It just buzzed when we went past the statue. So, the Cinderella Magic Band lives again. Thank goodness. I was so worried it was broken. Maybe she was your fairy godmother. Here we are. It's time for Tuska House. We're so excited for this. We were supposed to go back in 23 when I was here with my family. We had it booked, but for whatever reason, we didn't make it. So yeah, I'm really excited. I want to see what the place looks like cuz I have no idea from the outside. I think it really really is going to be like quite different. And then obviously the characters are amazing, but I'm actually really looking forward to the food as well. I feel like it's right up my street kind of food. I've done most of the character meals at some point or another and this one was actually one of my favorites. If you remember when I did this in 2023, I practically had the place to myself. So it' be really interesting to see. It's 2:00 p.m. So, it's kind of like a late lunch and definitely earlier than dinner. So, we'll see how many people are in there. And the podium for Tuska House is just back here. So, you do just walk right underneath. You've got the bar on the right hand side and then the podium is here. We needed to sit and wait and we literally barely had our butt on the seat. I don't think I actually sat entirely. No, I think I like touched the seat but not quite flat. You actually didn't totally get your butt on the seat and then our table was ready. So, this is amazing. Oh, I'm going somewhere different this time. They're going to love that. Thank you so much. Thanks, Vicki. [Music] Love that. I'm on the phone now, so hopefully you can hear me. Okay. I just wanted to show you what the main room looks like where you've got the buffet. The theming in here is just really awesome. I love it. There's a lot of options with the food as well. Got curry, corn cakes, potato masala. Then you got meats and cheeses and stuff. Lots of different salad which I'm going to be getting involved in in a minute. Oh, that looks good. There's like a watermelon and cucumber salad with onions and olives. Cla said this couscous is really nice. And then a lentil salad there. In the kids section, they got broccoli, sweet corn, some potatoes, mac and cheese, chicken strips. Then you got rice and chicken curry and a green shrimp curry. More couscous, brazed beef tjine, red red which is African stewed black eyed peas, a spiced cauliflower curry, North African pilow rice, potato curry, cardamom, granola. Then over here they have a carving station with various different meats. They've got meatballs there and pork. Down here they've got salmon, spice rub, rotisserie chicken. And then over here is the desserts. So you got lots of different mini desserts here. We are absolutely loving this experience already. As you can probably hear, it's quite loud in here. It's very busy today compared to when I was here last time and I was virtually the only person there. But it's actually really cute seeing the characters interacting with everybody else as well. You see some really nice moments and it's just really really fun to watch and we've had great interaction already. We've seen all of the characters twice and we've only been here about 30 minutes and you saw earlier they were like dancing around. That was really fun as well. And the food here is really nice. Claire was just saying, I'm sure she'll tell you when she gets back. Um, it's very, very flavorful. So, they've got lots of curries and even the salads and things are flavorful cuz I'm a very plain eater as a lot of you guys will know. I'm not very adventurous with food. Never have been. But all of the salads and everything and the breads and all the things that I would eat are also really flavorful and nice. So, I do love Pusca House. really rate it as a character experience. Compared to a lot of the others that I've done, this one is definitely up there. To be honest, I haven't done any that I didn't like really, apart from Chef Mickey's. I didn't enjoy that one particularly for various reasons. One of which is it feels like you're in a greenhouse because of the windows at the Contemporary. It would depend where you were sat, but I was sat in a really bad spot with the sunlight on me. Cla is back. She's just gone and got some more food. And you're loving the food, aren't you? I am absolutely loving the food. It's I had salad sort of stuff first of all and now I've gone back to get a bit more of the meat and curry. I feel like this is the food you've enjoyed the most since you've been here. Absolutely. Yeah, this is so good. Yeah, definitely. I really think Paul would love the food here. I was just saying that to Cla. So maybe this is something we'll do another time. And he's never done a character meal before, so that could actually be really good. And they do breakfast here as well. So, if this type of food isn't your thing, but you like breakfast, you can come and meet the characters for breakfast, too. So, definitely get this juice though. This juice is amazing. Me and Cla were just talking there and literally every table around us just then left cuz they were all done. The sound just left the room. It is so quiet now. This is what it was like last time I was here. We can now hear each other. Yeah, cuz we were shouting a little bit. It was very loud. I think they might be about to dance again. Goofy's just wandering in and he's like, \"Where is everyone? [Applause] Yeah, we were just saying like this experience here, you get so much interaction with the characters compared to other character meals that I've been to or just any experience really. When we did the story book dining last time Cla and I were here over at Wilderness Lodge, with that one, it was quite quick. So, we saw all the characters once and they kind of came along, took a photo and were gone again. And they just come around lots more times. Like, we've seen them all twice already and we still haven't even finished or had dessert or anything. So, probably they will then come around again, but also you saw them there. They're like dancing. They come up to you and like interact while they're doing that. It's just a lot of really good interaction. So, yeah, 100% of a character interaction, I would recommend this place and also Crystal Palace. [Music] Cla has got some dessert. A little bit of dessert, I will say. Yeah, the bread pudding is amazing. But I just said to Victoria, I wish that I could come back in 3 hours when my tummyy's not so full to have it. So, unfortunately, I'm going to miss out on that. But I've got a This was a guava mousse. Let me see if I can turn on this. There we go. So, that was a guava mousse and this was I think this was called like a popped de creme. It looks like a caramel chocolate thing. Yeah. I mean, I'm not sure if that's orange or caramel flavor. So, I'll be able to remain a minute. You've got Goofy behind you as well. Goofy is funny. Goofy has been really funny actually. [Music] It's definitely got a bit of a tart. Okay. Like a sewage. Yeah. I wouldn't say it's um a caramel. It's definitely more of a fruiness. A Thank you. A This has got like coconut at the bottom. He's pushing the chairs in. I think Donald might be waving to Goofy over there. I think he's trying to get Goofy's attention. This is what happens though. if you're here around 300 p.m. So, we got here at 2:00 and it was still very busy, but 3:00 p.m. now is quiet and dried down. And this is the time, now I think about it, that I was here. The last time was 3:00. Okay. And by the time it gets to this time, the characters are literally just here all the time, aren't they? We've seen them all like I don't know how many times entertaining us over and over again. They're being really funny. Yeah, they are. So, it's really really good. It's Donald again. Okay, it's just coming up 4:00, so we are going to head into Festival of the Lion King because it's right here by Tuska House. We've just got out of there. Absolutely love that experience. It is so amazing. And now we're going to see the show. I've missed this the last few times and so is Claire. So, we're really excited to see this. And then after that, it's going to be time to make our way to Disney Springs for candle making, which I loved last time. I'm really excited for this. I am, too. Yeah. We just got in here right at the last minute, like 5 minutes before, and we're right up front. And I've never ever sat right here on the floor pretty much. So, this is going to be a different experience. We do. We're not like literally right at the front, but almost right at the front. Like, we're going to have such a good view. Yeah, this is so cool. I've always been sat towards the back, so it's a really big like theater as well. You can see all the way around. I've never had this kind of low down floor perspective before, so that'll be interesting. We are here today to welcome you one and all to the festival of the Lion King. [Music] [Music] He will never forget. Everyone, arm in the air and on the counts of three, let's trumpet triumphant. 1 2 3. A mighty packer. Who's thrive with this thing? I'm glad you could make it. We can't have this celebration without you. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] dream for the merious sky. Meticulous planning, tenacity studies, decades of denial. simply why I became the skilled respected saluted and seen [Music] all the living. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Here we go again. [Music] [Applause] again. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] [Applause] That was incredible. It was so good. Like literally, you just said, didn't you, that's like maybe one of the best things. Like just completely one of the best things. I would prioritize that virtually over everything. It's so good. And you forget how good it is until you watch it again and then you're just like, \"Wow.\" It's like the the colors like every single person that comes out and there's a lot of people, isn't there, that are like part of the performers, they're just their dancing is so good. Like the acrobatics are amazing. And the guy that spins the fire, like how does he do that? He's amazing. It is incredible. And I just I love anything like that where you're just watching such incredibly talented people. Yeah, it's it is literally like you are going to the West End. It is that good a um quality, isn't it? It's so good. And I've actually come out of West End shows not having enjoyed it quite as much as that. It's just so high energy the whole way through. It's not too long as well. And they get you involved. Well, I sang throughout the whole bit to be honest. So, now we're going to go to Disney Springs cuz it is going to take a minute to get there. We need to go probably to Riviera on a bus, then from Riviera to Springs cuz there isn't a direct bus from the parks to Springs and we don't want to be late for our appointment to make a candle cuz I'm very excited. Definitely not. Yeah. So, we will be back here later in the trip though cuz we want to do Na'vi River Journey. We didn't cover a lot of the other Yeah. We didn't go to Asia at all, did we? Yeah. So, we need to come back. We've arrived at Disney Springs. So, they've got security here now. So, you have to go through that. That's not been the case for a while. Not at this location. Anyway, we're just on our way to Bose's Candles to do this candle making class. Look at these sweatshirts. This inside out one I love. Then there's Simba. I love that inside out one. Okay, here we are. It's right opposite Summer House on the Lake. I loved this last time, so I'm really excited to see their awesome range. We're just getting organized and CLA's doing the waiver. You just have to sign a little waiver to just acknowledge that you're working with hot wax and all of that kind of thing. And after we've done this, I'll give you the details on how much it is and how you book it. But we're very excited. I love doing stuff like this. Yeah, me too. If you're like crafty, you're a fan of doing things like that or you just want something completely different to do at Disney Springs, this is a really good option. And also, you just get to like sit in a beautiful smell. Yeah, it smells so good in here. They have so many different fragrances. They were just showing us some of them as we walked in. And I'm definitely going to get the Was it Clover? Yeah, there's one that's called Clover and it totally smells like the resort lobbies. And there's Resort Signature, which I already have, which really smells like the Riviera. And there's a little test that we do just to make sure that it's very firm. What we'll do is that we'll lift both of the the both the sticks up. Yep. Okay. It seems very firm, too, right? Yeah. Oh, man. Look at that. Looking good there. I feel very sciency. Yes. Yes. It's going to be only for this part. So, you know, don't trick or treat by itself. Oh, that's nice, too. Yes. Oh, that does smell like sweets. Like um that smells like fizzes that we were talking about the other day. It's candy. Yeah, candy. Yeah. If you squeeze both of them together, you would get this kind of Oh, yeah. That is nice. But yeah, that's nice. But I promise you guys, you'll be you'll be making better ones. This is a smile combo. I do actually really like both of those together. That's good. We talk all the time about Disney smells and like having Disney smells at home. This is just like ideal for that. So, now we got to pick up to three. You can mix up to three. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Oh, that smells like um caramel or coffee or something. That's very like um watery. I do actually really like broomstick and trickle treat together. I think it was Yeah, broomstick I think is my favorite one. All of those oils should equal to this ounce line right here. However, if you're mixing two, you can either go Yeah. halfway or you can put a little bit of each and see which one you kind of prefer and then you can go on from there. Yeah. And it gives you a lot more freedom. Of course. I might do half and half up to there. Don't drink it. Oh no. That really smells like something I've had to drink since we've been here. That is a great drink. I just can't think exactly what it is. Well, where have we been? What What about that pear thing you had the other day? It could have been. That was an animal kingdom. I love that. I'm really really happy with that one. I could almost do my nails. Yeah, you could. Yeah, you could do. You sure can. I'm probably gonna do the same type of thing that I did last time, but with like four colors, cuz that one came out okay. I I was pretty pleased with that. Does that look like a pumpkin? Yeah, it does. Okay, just get my fan out. Yeah, you could try it. That's actually a legitimate technique. Speed up the process. You can tell it's obviously strong cuz it's just blown all the pens off. Yeah, those easy fans are honestly very strong. They have so many uses. They really do. They're honestly the best. Just get one. Trust me. Well, cuz I did one of these um in the spring. So, I've gone for this kind of same design but in autumn colors. I was going to do a ghost and stuff. I was like that that could be complicated. Let's not do that. I'm no artist. So, see how we're looking. I'm pretty happy with that. Basically the same as the last one, but with like an autumn fall design. And I think I'm going to go like pale orange for the color of the candle that it's very autuminal. That does look really good. Love it. Pretty. Amazing. I'll just put just a tad bit. You know, tad bit won't hurt anything. I think that's very light actually, but still. We'll do very light first. I think that looks really quite good now. Yes. Yeah, I think that one might need maybe a little bit more. Yeah, I think you need more. This is what it will look like. But obviously at the moment it looks a lot darker. Oh, look there. It's starting to dry like set already. You can see and CLA's looks really dark purple at the moment, but it'll be pale. Oh, yeah. Okay, that's good. Yeah. Thank you so much. So, how much does it cost to do? So, it's going to be $30 per candle. Oh, perfect. you get a chance to decorate your jar. You can also make your own color and make your own scent. Amazing. And do people have to book or can they just walk in or So there's a there's both ways you can do them. In my opinion, making a reservation is the best way so that you can always have space. Great. Um you can always risk it and come in. We always take walk-ins, so as long as there's space, they'll let you guys in. Okay. And can people book online or do they call up or you can give us a call or you can find our number online as well at.com. Yeah. Amazing. Thank you so much. Thank you. My pleasure. So, just stepped out of the candle store. We need to wait about 20 minutes to come back. I did buy myself some stuff as well. Look at the sky out here. This is absolutely beautiful. We just kind of stepped outside to it. I love the Florida sky. Honestly, I've been waiting to see this pink peachy colored sky since we got here. I've just come around the back of Summer House on the Lake to see this look. Oh my goodness. Beautiful. Claire is running. How pretty. I know. It's amazing, isn't it? I love it. It's so nice just sitting here at Disney Springs. Such an amazing breeze, this beautiful sky. So, I thought you guys could sit here, too. I'm going to put you right here. And you can also just sit and take it all in. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] So, we're all done now picking up our candles. We've just done that and we're going to go into We're pretty tired at this point. Maybe slightly bordering on Delirious. We're going to go into Disney style, though, because those jumpers and things we saw on the way past or sweatshirts if you're in the US. We call them jumpers in the UK. It's a very British word, a jumper. Let me just go and put my jumper on. do want to take a look at them because they look really nice. Yeah. Look, these are the other ones. These are the ones that I've seen already. I saw the daisy one at that one is nice. Oh, they got a marie. Yeah, I love that. I saw this one in the window. This looks like it's a special brand. So, Stony Clover, I've never really heard of it. Is $99. It's kind of pricey, but I do love it. These bags are really nice, too. I just love this design. They are quite cool. Yeah, that jacket's very cute. And a nice brown. That's expensive. And yeah. Is there anything on the back? Oh, that's actually really cool. That one is $199. $200. That's kind of pricey. And to be fair, I would only ever wear this at Disney World, but I do love it. This is really different as well. It looks like a kind of racing style jacket. It's got all four parks at the top there. It's like a cropped jacket. They also have these fluffy jumpers for Minnie and Daisy and Donald. [Music] I do love that because it looks like the kind of jumper your nan might have knitted you when you were younger, like with the pattern knitting patterns that you could get. But I kind of like that about it. These are the ones that we could see earlier. I love the inside out one. It is gray, which is not my favorite color, but I do really like it. Oh, look at the back. Oh my goodness. It is $59.99. [Music] That really is a nice quite thin fabric. Oh, I'm really tempted by that. Because we are coming back here on our final day, I may live to regret this, but I am going to think about it. I know you're all probably screaming thinking, \"Get it if you really want it cuz it might not be there in your size.\" But I am going to chance it. If it's still here on our last day, then it's meant to be. Should I put them on? Yeah. Oh, the tail nearly hit you in the face. [Music] Do I look like Eel? I feel like you would need the Eeyore t-shirt or some kind of other Eeyore, you know, apparel to make those ears work on their own. They're quite Yeah. See that? See that? That works better if you have the t-shirt on. If you just have the ears, it's very random. Like with your kind of jungle print floral dress, it's a bit of an odd choice. They have this shirt as well. I would say this is a shacket because it's thicker than a shirt but more shirty than jackety. They have some really unique stuff in here actually. And there's Pooh again. Scared of his shadow over there. Yeah, we saw this one in the Magic Kingdom. Pooh Bear afraid of his shadow. I just think that is very cute. A and he is Oh, bless him. Look at his first. It's quite good, isn't it? Yeah. I love that. You got it, sweet cakes. No more talking, singing. And they've got this cardi with the pumpkin micy's on. Look at this dress, too. This is really cute. Okay, we are going to head back now. We've done quite a lot today. We did Tuska House. We did the candle making. And we're just going to head back and get ourselves ready for bed. We're quite tired. And tomorrow we are going to Mickey's Nots So Scary Halloween party. Yay. We're so excited for that. We loved it last year. And I really, really, really want Cla to see the full parade. Yeah. Yeah. So do I. That is like the the Halloween party is the thing that I've probably thought about the most about coming on this holiday. So I am really looking forward to it. And we'll have like um we're going to start later as well, aren't we? We're not going to like get there until like 12ish maybe maybe even after that. I've been there till like 1:30 in the morning before. So we'll start a little bit later, but we do have also like a late lunch, early dinner at Crystal Palace. So we'll be seeing the Winnie the Pooh characters and then the Halloween party. So, next week's vlog will be a really good one. So, don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already. I was really, really, really enjoying doing these vlogs, experiencing everything, sharing it with you, meeting such a good holiday. Yeah. And we're meeting so many so many. Yeah. Like, I don't I do not know how many people we met today, but it was a lot. And all of you were so lovely and we love talking to you. So, thank you so much to everyone who comes up to say hi. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to watch this vlog. I really do appreciate it more than you know. and everything that you guys do, liking, commenting, subscribing. All of you when you come up in the parks, just say how much you love the vlogs and that is why I do them and I just absolutely love it. So, thank you and I hope you're all having a great week and we will see you next Saturday for Mickey's going. Bye. There you are. See? And there's my little girl. She's bouncing around. Very happy to see you. And that's my son coming along as well. So yeah, I will remember that forever. Ah, thank you so much. Oh, we love you. [Music]"

      "transcript": "Hello you guys and welcome to another prep and pack with me for Disney World. I'm so excited. Dean and I are getting to steal away to Disney World for about 48ish hours by ourselves. I am very excited. We're celebrating my birthday while we're there. We're doing some fun things. So, let's just jump into all the exciting details cuz I'm pretty sure prepping and packing for Disney is just about as fun as being there. Honestly though, this pack with me is very last minute. probably the most last minute that I've ever done because it's been busy. This trip has been on the books for literally months. We are staying at Saratoga Springs. So, I used our DVC points. We are staying in a onebedroom cuz I'm like, \"Mama wants a bubble tub. I'm going to go over to Disney Springs and get some bath bombs.\" I'm like, \"Every night we're get we're a bath bomb. I don't care if I'm in the bathtub for like 5 minutes. I am going to enjoy that tub to the fullest.\" So, I'm really excited about it, but we've had it booked for a while, but it has just been extremely busy. You know how it goes. Life gets in the way, things keep creeping up, and I'm like, you know what? We leave our flights at 6:45 in the morning tomorrow. I've already checked in. Like, we have got to get this done. Um, but in true fashion, you know how it is as a mom too, and a parent, a lot of times you go last. If this was my kid's like birthday, I would have been like doing all this other stuff and all this prep and outfits and princess dresses and glow sticks and bubble wands and I'm like not doing any of that right now. So, it's like, okay, we've we've got some we got some catching up to do. Mama mama needs some pampering as well. Um, but to quickly kind of go over it, we are flying down on Saturday, early Saturday morning, so we can have all day Disney. We got that 6:45 a.m. flight. Um, and then we are doing like Disney parks, all kinds of fun stuff. I've got like a little checklist of things, which we can talk about later, but I've got some like every time I think of something that I'm like, I would love to do this. I would love to go back and just be able to like soak it in and enjoy this without the kids. Like I love my kids. I love taking them to Disney. Like they that is my favorite. Family trips are my favorite. But there's also times that it's like if you're a parent, you can probably relate. If not, you're some unicorn or whatever. But it is one of those situations where it's like this would be really nice to just slow down, no distractions. I love my little distractions, but no distractions, be able to like soak this in and enjoy it. And also get some one-on-one time with my hubby. That is very nice. And getting to like actually finish conversation or eat a meal while it's hot. Like those the little things that you just kind of take for granted when you don't have kids. But we're going to do that. I have all day Sunday that we're going to do things. We're going to go to the parks. I again, I don't really have much of a plan. I just have a checklist of like things I would like to do. Maybe we'll put it more into an itinerary, but right now that's the best I could do. I'm like I'm just I'm at least starting a note and we're going to add things like snacks I want to go eat, things I want to do, rides I want to ride with Dean, like so we can actually sit together and like those sorts of things. So, I have a list of that. got all day Sunday to have so much fun and we've got most of Monday. We'll check out on Monday. Tried to schedule it over the weekend because we're leaving the girls with family and so they have a job so it's like okay don't want to be a burden on them and so it works out. They have a lighter load on Monday work from home and so that whole thing works out but we are going to be having a later flight that day. I think our flight's at like 7 or so in the evening. So, we basically have all day long. So, I'm really excited about that's kind of our trip overview. Very loose trip overview. I know it's not not very detailed like my normal. I don't have dining booked. I have one thing of like one day of Lightning Lanes and I'm like I don't it feels very weird but I'm excited and I'm also ready to just like walk around and sip coffee and just look at things like I just want to go and do that and take pictures like a pretty stuff and I just I'm like that's that's what I'm looking forward to which sounds I don't know that may sound nerdy but like it's that's what I'm looking forward to is just being there and enjoying it and also I can taste the spring rolls and hear the music right now. So, let's get packing. Okay. Oh, the washer's empty. That's a nice surprise. I have a wonderful husband, you guys. And before you go to the comments of like, \"Oh, I wish my husband would wash clothes.\" It's like, okay, here's the thing. We had a conversation a few years back where we were just talking about our relationship and how we felt like about things and anything that we were like working on or needing to work on. And there were times I'm like, \"Hey, I would appreciate your help.\" And he's like, \"I want to help, but sometimes I don't feel like I know what to do.\" And I'm like, \"Okay, when you don't know what to do, just pretend you don't have me. You're a single dad. you're still single. Such good advice. This is the one where you're like, \"Hey, can you just do the things that you would do if I wasn't here?\" I was like, \"Oh, man.\" Started doing the dishes, making a bed, and it was pretty great. I like that. It It clicked. Yeah, it clicked and made sense. I can't take credit for that cuz I heard somebody that's way better at marriage than I am talking about it. I don't even remember who it was cuz I'd love to give them credit, but I don't know who that was. But either way, it was great advice. It worked well for us. So, I'm just passing that along before anybody's like, I wish my husband would do that cuz I'm like, I don't want to start hubby envy. And no, you can't have mine. Back off. Yay. Okay. Well, welcome to the closet. I got to figure out some outfits. I've got some ideas in my head of things that I want to wear, like things I want to pack. There's a big box here that's just out of frame. You can't see it. There's a laundry basket here that's full of clothes. Half are folded, half are not folded. There's a stack of clothes that are folded that are laying on top of this basket that I need to put away. And there's a pile of dirty clothes right under the tripod. That's where we're at. I'm just I'm keeping it 100 today, you guys. If I didn't have like underwear laying here, I'd be showing you, but I'm like, I don't want my oven underwear on the internet. But here we are. This is this is the reality. So, I wanted to share this cuz sometimes it's like I am on top of it. We are checking off all the checklist and then there's other times like I promise I am a real person. I'm not completely organized and perfect all the time. There are sometimes I'm like I even impressed myself today. I'm just like, \"Oh, girl, what are we doing?\" And but we're getting it done. We're getting it done. I'm like, \"We're just going to We're This is This is going to live to fight another day.\" Usually I'm like, \"Let's do future us a favor.\" If you've seen me on spoonful, then you know we ain't that girl is just going to have to handle this. I can't today. Me can't do this. Okay, so this was a find at Disney. It is so loud, you guys. And I I love it so much. I've been a Pooh Bear girl since I was like itty bitty. But I'm like, I want to take it and I want to wear it, but I'm also worried it's going to be too hot for it cuz it's going to be mid80s and it's going to get down into the 70s. But I'm like, sometimes 70s are cool enough, sometimes they're not. What the heck? I have an entire carry-on suitcase to myself. I'mma take it. This is also where I'm like overthinking everything. Way too much. Way too much. All right. So, starting to get some things. Got the washer started. So that feels good with the clothes that need to be washed and also that I'm wanting to wear. So we're going to we're going to get that done. At least that's doing future me a favor. Um I'm telling you guys, I just it's there's we're just we're juggling a lot. Suffice to say, we're juggling. We're juggling a lot. I know everyone is like I'm sure people feel this in your own way. like you just you have busy seasons and it's like where everything is happening at the same time and it's like oh this would be really good to do and like sometimes you're in slow seasons, sometimes you're in a juggle season. I feel like there's like no in between and that's just us right now. We're we're in a hardcore juggle season. I'm going to go ahead lay some of these things out. I'm like grabbing stuff that I'm like, \"Oh, we need this and that.\" And so I need to like start systematically kind of going through and making sure like, \"All right, this is together and organizing everything.\" I'm going to lay it on on the bed so I can visually put eyes on it. Be like, \"All right, we're good.\" And check off the packing list. Yeah. Let's Let's Let's get some stuff done. Woo! packing like this. and for not taking the kids is always so interesting to me. I'm like I feel like I'm underdressed or something. Like it's one of those like I'm so used to taking so much for them and so many other things and thinking about so many people. I'm like this feels weird. It feels strange. Feels very strange. Now that the laundry is going, I have gotten all of this stuff pulled out ready to go. So, we got the park bag, which is feeling very slim cuz usually it's like a like backup outfits and wet bags and snacks and all this. I mean, we still are taking snacks, don't get me wrong, but we got that. Got our rain jackets. Got a lot of stuff for in the park. So, we can go through that and like pack the bag together of like what it looks like when we don't have kids cuz I know I have people that actually travel without kids. So, you can maybe get a glimpse of what that looks like for us without kids. And then we have our um filtered water bottles. Absolutely love these. They are stainless steel so they're going to go off when you go through the metal detector. But they're fantastic. These are 34 oz and they have filters that you can put in them so it t makes the water not taste so bad. If you know, you know. If you don't consider yourself lucky. I'm one of those people. I cannot drink a lot of just like straight Florida water unfiltered cuz my tummy is like it makes it very angry. That may be TMI, but we're besties here so I'm sharing. So, got my purse. It's going to be my like personal It's not a mommy bag cuz I'm not being mommy this weekend, but it's it's my purse. I'm excited. It's not a bag that's for anybody else. I bought this on Amazon as my purse a few weeks back or so. And I'm like, I love this bag. So, I'm just going to use that one. Oh, and the airplane blankie cuz mama gets cold. Moving this party to the bathroom so we can take care of toiletries. So, I'm going to use my small travel bag that's literally been sitting on my counter since our last trip. I again, we're just jumping all over the place. Yep. Yep. We're just We're getting it done, though. So, most of it's already packed. I just need to go through and like see if there's anything I need to restock. Got my handy dandy checklist here. So, I'm just kind of going through and doing that. Hm. Interesting. One moment. Okay. Sorry. Had a phone call. I love my transportation company. They know us so well. They're like, \"You guys always request four people. You have four guests on the reservation and you have two car seats. We just want to make sure.\" And I'm like, \"No, it's just my husband and I.\" But they just like on top of it with our reservations. So, I appreciate that. They actually caught it one time when I forgot to request car seats and they were like, \"Hey, just follow it up.\" And I'm like, \"You guys are fantastic.\" So, can't sing their praises enough. So, if you are looking for a company, I've tried a lot over the years. And also, while we're on the topic of transportation, that also reminds me there are two companies in Orlando called MCO to Disney. If you are not using this one, MCO, the number two, Disney, then you're probably gonna have a bad experience because I've had a few of the internet fam to accidentally just type it in cuz they hear me say the name. They type it in and then they go and book it and they don't have a good experience. Usually the car smells like smoke, it's nasty, the car seats look like they're forever old and like this whole situation. And come to find out, they actually booked their own company. So, just sharing that little PSA. I've got a few of like ah that's not great and like their reviews aren't great. So, I want to make sure that you use the right ones. These guys are fantastic. Seriously, we have loved every single one of them. They've been so sweet, so kind. So, I'll link the information and my discount code down below. So, if you're wanting to check them out, be sure to do that. You don't don't put don't book the other people. Don't look the other people. No, please don't do that. Okay, before I pack this, I just have to talk about it because if you've been victimized by hairbrush commercials on Instagram in your feed for this like fancy brush that like removes the oils and whatever, maybe it's just my feed, but I was getting tons of those and I'm like, I'm very intrigued by this. But the brush was like $70. And I'm like, I'm not about to spend $70 for a hairbrush. And so I found this one, which is like the same thing on Amazon. It's $16. At least when I bought it was $16. Like I hate saying prices with Amazon cuz they like constantly are fluctuating, which is weird. But love this one. It is a bors hair bristle. And seriously, it is cut way down on the amount of dry shampoo that I've been using. I brush it every morning, every evening, and just like do the whole like Rapunzel and I brush and brush and brush my hair and not to be dramatic, but this this brush is like the best thing ever. I love it. It works great on my girls hair. It looks works great with Bella's pretty curly hair. Um, it's like tight curls, but she's got curls to it. So, I feel like it works great with that and like distributing the oils through your hair, so you need like less product. I really like it. So, I'm going to I'm going to share it. I I talk about things if I love them and that brush I'm like this is way better than I expected. I apologize if there is a low roaring in the background. I have our neighbor to my left that is mowing their grass. The neighbor to the right has people they are putting in sprinklers. So they're like using this like ditch witch heavy machinery over there. So, we've got like a roar on both sides and it is 2:11 and so like my daylight is fading fast. So, I'm like trying to finish this video so I can't wait for them to stop. So, I apologize if there's like a low roaring. Hopefully, it's not too annoying. But, I've got all of the things together for my purse. So, let's talk about that. Here's the situation. Yes, I have stuff from my Amazon haul. If you want to see what that is, head over to Spoonful. I need to clean it up. I'm aware. Okay, so we've got the purse. Got insulated water bottle, stainless steel filter. We discussed that. It's amazing. Misting fan because you got to meds case. So, I've got a little bit of everything from motion meds to pain relievers and uh all kinds of stuff in there. Cold medicines. A little spray sunscreen for any reapplication that might need to happen outside of the room. Wet ones. Little sanitizer wipes. Body glide. If you don't have a thigh gap, this is your best friend. Love that so much. Got some body lotion from Disney cuz it was left over from my last trip. I've got powder sunscreen. This is great for your hairline cuz most likely I'm going to be rocking a slick back pony if it's still as hot as it has been. It is just not the season to not rock that look. And then I've got battery charger. Plugs in. Has the cables on both sides. I'm trying to rapid fire this you guys. The sunboss gloss sanitizer. the magnetic little thing for my phone. It suctions. I have a magnetic case that's on the back. So, this can stick to things, but this can suction to things. So, we got options. Motion sickness patches. I've got two of these. I should probably grab a couple more. One for both of our flights. These things are seriously amazing. Love those so much. Hand sanitizer. And then a highlighter and my word search and my coffee collar. coffee sleeve that is that kind of keeps it insulated a little bit so your coffee lasts slightly longer in the Disney heat. So all that except for the water bottle obviously that's not going in there but all of this stuff is going to go right in here and everything fits and it zips you guys. We did good. Okay, everything I like everything but the fan. So the fan is going in the backpack and the water bottle. No stroller, no problem. I have a diner. Okay, so we are taking our backpack. I love that this one expands. It's got what's technically a shoe compartment, but we always use this bottom section for our like rain gear pocket. So, this is where our jackets will go. So, we love a good rain jacket. We got some new nice Columbia ones and I'm so excited. It was hilarious, though. We go. It had been raining, raining, raining, and we're like, \"Okay, let's let's find some jackets.\" We ended up being there and at the outlet mall in Florida during taxfree weekend. So between deals and then you know we saved a little bit on tax. So you know that's something. But we got these rain jackets. And of course it rains like one time the entire rest of our trip because we bought new rain gear. Every time you would think it was coming, it did. It just stopped right before it got to us and we needed to pull anything out. I'm like, \"All right, that's that's the new play.\" apparently is you buy rain gear and you don't have to use it cuz the weather's like psych. Gotcha. You thought you needed that, but you didn't. So, we got that in the bottom of the bag. And then we're going to have our water bottles. Got Dean has his little bag and he was testing it out. There we go. So, we've got the water bottle that it will go in here. This is Why am I struggling so hard to put a water bottle in a pocket? This is crazy. Got my water bottle that will also go over here. I need to put this little thing. I love these little straps for our bottles. It makes it so much easier to hold on to if you're needing to hang them off of something. Usually, we hang them off of like our stroller hook or something like that, but even for this, it can be handy if you're needing to like walk through the bar and just like carry the water bottle. Got that. I'm still taking my snack pouch. So, we've got like some meat sticks and stuff like that in here that we enjoy to eat as well. So, we've got some chomps and whatnot in that pouch. I'm still going to take the little popup hairbrush cuz, you know, I might need to brush my own hair. The girls aren't the only ones that need their hair brushed. And then I grabbed these. These are for the kids. They're like little aluminum foil covers. I'll usually put them in like on the um cups that you can get at Disney. And they usually don't come with lids. I can put this around it and you put the straw in and it helps it spill less. So, I got these though and I'm going to take them anyway. Even though the kids obviously aren't going on this trip, I just think that could be handy even like for drinks or something. I'm just going to take it. So, we're going to do that. Got this twisty little tripod that we can attach and put places if we want to make photos. Put that easy access in the front pocket of that. Um, got our sunscreen pouch. We'll put that in here. Got our rain. It's basically a rain jacket for your backpack. So, this goes over the front of your bag and it buckles and it helps keep your backpack dry. So, if you're out and walking, we don't use it quite as often. Usually, it's under the rain cover on the stroller. But, again, we don't we don't have that this this trip. I'm one of the weird people. I really like my stroller. Like I'm tempted to take our single and just be like, \"Oh, the kids are with grandparents. It's just our stroller.\" I'm just kidding. We won't do that. But seriously, I kind of I miss it. I'm one of these people that I'm like, \"Hm, I wonder.\" I know. At some point, obviously, we're going to run out of stroller time. Do you keep taking a stroller or do you switch? And they've got those little push carts. They look like a little travel personal shopping cart that's like the size of a compact stroller. And I'm just wondering if Disney would allow that. I'm just saying that would be nice. I just don't want to carry the backpack around. Like I want my stuff and we need our stuff and we use our stuff, but I don't want to carry the stuff. I don't know. Just thinking out loud. So, got my fan that's going in here. Dean's fan is also going in here. Our Magic Band pouch. I'm just taking the whole pouch even though it's just the two of us. We got tissues here. I think that's about it. I need to put some wipes. Wipes in our travel bag cuz even though the kids aren't going, we still need wipes. It is a necessity. I feel like everybody needs wipes. Um H Okay, I think that's it cuz I took the stuff that we didn't Yeah. What the heck? I'm going to take this, too. This is our meds case. I had taken the pack out and put it in my purse. But this also has more of those like motion stickers behind it. So, I'm going to take it, too. It's little. It's like negligible that I'm even like putting it in here. So, we got that. We just got to do the wipes. Oh, also I want to stick one of these on the top. I grabbed these for like $3.99 for the entire pack, which was a steal. What I felt like was a steal. These are awesome. They'd be great around like put around the bar of your stroller. If you wanted a carabiner style thing, you could add that to it. But what I'm going to do with it is put it around the top of our backpack here. And then we can take our popcorn bucket and hook it to this so nobody's left carrying the pocket or the popcorn bucket. So that's my idea cuz I'm so excited. I'm so ready. I can taste the maple popcorn right now. I'm looking forward to it. I'm I'm a late bloomer when it comes to the maple popcorn. I know a lot of people have been on that train for years. I'm finally jumped on it. And it's so good. And I don't know why it took me so long to try it. I'm just I've always been like, \"Sweet popcorn. Ew, who wants that?\" I do. I want sweet popcorn. All right, so resort stuff. I grabbed this packing cube cuz usually that's what I put resort things in. But this time, we're taking our travel sound machine cuz I love this thing. It is the most powerful one and literally hands down the best. Got my little phone case for if we go swimming at the pool. And then the charger pack. So, it's got our phone chargers, Magic Band chargers, extra chargers for fans and gear. So, I could honestly just throw that in here. And that's the resort gear. And then that. So, I actually don't need that packing cube. So, this is ready to go in the suitcase. That was easy. Outfit rundown cuz they have been picked. So, I have my travel day outfits. I've got this white um pullover sweatshirt. Super comfy. And then a little athletic set kind of bra and um leggings set. It is so comfy. Got Dean his jeans. I still need to pick out a shirt for him or he can pick a shirt, but he's a flying jeans kind of guy. I don't know if anybody else has a hubby like that, but or if anyone else is like that. I know some people they're like, I don't like to fly in shorts. I can't do it. So, everybody's flavor is a little different. Our outfit for once we get there. It's this green tank and pants set. It's kind of a lighter, not linen, but it is like nice and breezy, comfy feeling. Love that set. And then I've got him his striped gray shirt, some black shorts, cuz the black shorts are his staple. Like that is like the color of his shorts. I've got a white t-shirt kind of a I think it's called dolman style. So, it's a little oversized style kind of fit, but I also have this purple knit cardigan and a tank top, like a a built-in bra tank that I can wear with this. So, I've got these shorts that I'm going to wear under it just because I just always like to wear shorts under my skirts. But, I have this really cute skirt and I'm so excited. I'm like saving it to wear there. But it is got a little bow on it. I thought it's cute. But it's an actual skirt. I wish it was a skirt. I will say though, if you get this, size up. I bought my original size of a medium and apparently I needed to go to an extra large, you guys. Like two sizes. So, if you are buying this, size up. Not one, but two sizes, please. Um, also, I know my nails need to be done. They are horrid. So, we've got this. That is my outfit. Got him a blue button-up shirt, some shorts. Honestly, he really likes those shirts. I think he looks handsome in them, but also he likes like more button-up style shirts cuz they tend to like hold their shape and not kind of fall apart as much during the day of his black shorts once again. And then a Donald t-shirt. We actually got this on our past trip. And then I've got the matching Daisy sweater. I don't know that I can wear this, but I'm hoping I can. We'll see if I can like roll the sleeves up a little bit and get away with it. But I do have a tank. Again, built-in bra. Love it. Literally only one of my outfits requires a bra, you guys. I don't know if anyone else gets that excited about those things. I do. I love that kind of stuff. And then also got it paired with this floral skirt. It does have shorts built into it, which is awesome. And I thought the daisy print and like the florals with the purple, I think it looks cute together. So, I'm going to go with it. Got a black built-in bra tank for our last day. So, that was like outfit one of the day. Outfit two of the day. This is final day. Got black tank with again the built-in bra, which is awesome. It is kind of a ribbed detail, which is fantastic. Got my denim shorts. And then this um Pooh Bear shirt or jacket that I showed you guys earlier. And then Dean had bought this on one of our other previous trips. We got to Disney a lot, you guys. But he had bought this and it matches basically perfectly. It's actually faded a little bit in the sun, I feel like, with him wearing it, but it matches almost perfectly. Got a red shirt cuz Poo Bear wears a red shirt. So, there you go. That's that. Got our jammies. Got swimsuits, cover-ups for both of us. And then my toiletries are right over here. Just need to pack my makeup, which I'll do in the morning. And then he's got to pack his contacts. And then um or he'll wear his contacts, but he'll pack his glasses and contact solution for tomorrow. And I think that's basically it cuz I have toiletries enough for him. Toothbrush, toothpaste, uh, deodorant, all that good stuff in my toiletry bag. So, I think I think we've almost checked everything off. So, now we've just got to put in the suitcase, which is super easy cuz we are this time we had enough flight points and like we have a Southwest credit card, so we had racked up enough flight points with Southwest to actually get both of our flights for free round trip, which was fantastic. Very rarely happens. So, I was very excited to like find like just enough points. I think we had like 30 points left over after I bought them. So, it was just enough points and the flight like point usage was at the right amount and it just worked out. Like I've been trying to use these silly points for forever now and it's just not matched up. It was like, okay, you either don't have enough and you're going to have to buy points. I'm like, I really don't want to buy points cuz this is just like spending more than I would have on the flight if I just bought it. It was it was never a good deal. The math just did math. And so we finally worked it out. So we have a personal item and a carry-on that we get. Obviously, usually we fry spirit, so we don't get a personal item. And then any bags we buy. So for this it feels like overkill cuz usually our 48 hour trips, we're all cramming into personal item only. And I'm like, I'm not buying bags. It's 48 hours. We can survive. But we have room. So this is weird. All right. So, I'm not doing packing cubes or anything. We're just lazy throwing it in here right now. And it all fit in the bottom. So, we're good. Got the toiletries brush, uh, toothbrushes, charging pack, room stuff, pajamas, and swimsuit. and room left over. So, I am happy with that. Just need to throw like socks and underwear in there and I think we're packed. So, let's do this again for Dean stuff and we'll be ready to go. Well, that worked, didn't it? I just knocked something over. I'm all good. Thank you. And then here's Dan's suitcase. So all the stuff easily fit. You just need to clip the little buckle. We've got his socks, swimsuit, and little Donald bag. Like this is weird. This is so simple. And with that, I think we are packed and ready for our Disney trip. other than those last couple of little morning things.

      "transcript": "I I [Music] take me home today. Take me out to play. Take me back into that sweet sweet. Good morning everyone. Welcome to a brand new day at Walt Disney World. We're here at Allstar Sports and we're off to Epcot today, which is my favorite. Guardians Day. Yeah, Cla's I mean Cla's favorite is Guardians. What is your favorite park? I find it actually so difficult. I don't know. I don't know. Today it might be Epcot. Every day that she's in a park, that's her favorite park. And this morning, we're meeting up with Kate because it is her birthday. I will get Kate to briefly say hello. I won't kind of film all of that because it's her birthday, but I will get her to say hi to you cuz I know you will all want to say hi to Kate. And um yeah, we've got so much on the agenda today. We've got GO82, we've got Guardians, Food and Wine Festival, so much that we're going to do. And we may well go to Target today. Yes, we didn't do that yesterday. We were too tired because it was our first day. And we've got some nice sunshine this morning, which is good. It was quite overcast yesterday. It will probably rain today. It will rain every day in September. But yeah, well, the ground is quite wet, isn't it? Yeah. We're all done with breakfast at Yach Club. Look who's here. Hi. I know you guys really wanted to say hi to Kate. It's her birthday today. I'm feeling very special, very special today. Breakfast. It was so good, wasn't it? Al and Humpus breakfast. It's one of the best I've had at Disney actually. Lots of choice. Not too big of a We all know that I can't cope with that. No, it gets dangerous as well with two big buffets. But it's buffet and an entree that you get. So, it's good. Yeah, it was actually really good value and um service was good. Lovely settings. It's not too hot today, so I can wear my hair down so I'm not um turning into Monica from France. Always good. Always good. Have you had a good week though so far? It's been so good. And it's um Martin's first time in probably over 20 years. He's been super enthusiastic. So, we've packed lots in and we're off to Clear Water today to see some family. Yeah, just a nice chilled day really spoiled birthday present. I know everyone's miss Kate in the vlogs. So, I had to get her to say hi in the vlogs before we head off. And we're going off to um Epcot now. And like I say, you're off to Clear Water. Say hi to Kate though in her comments. And happy birthday. Okay, we're all done in there and we've just come out here taking a few photos of the beautiful yacht club. It looks so good. And the lobby looked amazing. They had like a revamp in there. Yeah. And the um the restaurant as well. I absolutely loved it. Felt such a posh. It does feel. It really would be like if I was taken there like out on a sort of date meal. You really feel like it's fancy. Yeah, it does. But it's not super expensive. What we had um I took a photo of it. I'll put it in. So you got an entree and you could go to the buffet which had it's like a continental buffet. So pastries, fruit, they had yogurts, didn't they? Devil had some overnight oats. Yeah. And you get that as well. And you get your coffee tea. Coffee or tea. I think I didn't think that when I was looking at the app last night cuz I wanted to see what the breakfast options were and how much it cost. When I was looking at it, I didn't understand that you did get one of the entre with it. $28 and I thought that's quite a lot for just like pastries and fruit and stuff, but actually the fact that you get your drink and you can have a mane like cooked as well. I think that's that's actually reasonable. I think I had the French toast and it had a nice syrup over it and some bits of banana chopped up and then you can either have bacon or sausage which to me does seem a little bit weird to have like bacon and sausage with pancakes but totally normal. I know it's American and and and it was actually really yummy. Yeah. Yeah, it was really really good. We really enjoyed it and it was great to see Kate as well. But now we're off to Epcot. I'm so excited and we're going to ride Ratatouille first hopefully. So we're going to And I love France. Yeah, I love the France. So, I want to have a little wonder around France anyway. Yeah. I can't do Impressions to France till later if I do do it at all because it's impressions to France the show. What's that then? It's like a very old school little show, but it's retro. I love it. But they don't show it until the evening. During the day is the Beauty and the Beast sing along, so I may get to do that later in the trip. But yeah, we got lots on the agenda today. So, let's get going. I love walking into this park so much. I always just get a feeling that is different to walking into other parks when I come to Epcot because I love it so much. It's quite a sort of relaxed Yes. feel, I think. Yeah, it is definitely compared to walking into some of the other parks. It just feels chilled. And because it's my favorite, I just know what kind of day I'm going to have. But I am a little bit disappointed with the lack of blue sky this morning. It's very cloudy. Cla likes photos and taking pictures. And obviously when you've got gray skies, it's not quite the same vibe. So we like a bit of blue sky, please. But like temperature- wise, I'm I'm quite happy, but you think it's a bit sticky. A room where a shower's just been really hot or like a swimming pool changing rooms. Do you know what vibe I'm talking about? It's like that, but it's definitely not hot compared to what I've been told it has been. So, we're actually very lucky to have come this week. It's also quite nice at this time of day because you get to see the World Showcase like this later in the day. It definitely gets so much busier and you very rarely would see it quiet like this when festivals are on. You know, everybody's coming along and having their snacks. So, this is quite nice actually to see it this quiet. I must admit though, I always miss it when it's not flower and garden festival. Oh yeah. I really want to come when it's flower and garden. It looks so nice in the vlogs in people's photos. Oh my gosh, it does. Like this bit for example, you normally have Cogsworth and Lumiere. There'd be loads of flowers. It still looks beautiful, but it is just a totally different look when it's flower and garden and it's so nice. Says it's a 25minute wait. There are people queuing outside. We might do single rider cuz we just want to get as much done in the day as we can. Let's do this bit here. I just love. Look at this. It's all the little details as well. Like in this window here, you've got this petissery. It's just very beautiful. I love all of this. Right. Okay, let's see. Let's do a time check. It is 10:14. Just on my phone now, and we literally got through in 2 minutes. Just walked right up to the front. [Music] [Music] Just doing a bit more exploring now of this pavilion. It's so beautiful. It really is. And we got on to Ratatouille literally as a walk-on. I thought that like the single rider we would at least be like there for 5 minutes. I don't think it was. I walked up there was what four people in front of us. And she went row two, row three, and then you went straight on. Yeah. Although when I did get down there, I think I turned back to like look at you as I was going and she'd sent me to number one. So by the time I got there, they'd like closed the fence and and she went, \"Are you okay, ma'am?\" And I was like, she told me to come here. And I was like, \"Oh, should I go back?\" She said, \"No, no, no, it's okay.\" So then they did open the the fence and then I had to wait for them to lift up the the bar again to then get in. But they did. They put me in. So it just meant that it it took up a little bit more time. But I feel that I I was the last person that got sent. So I shouldn't have been sent almost to the furthest one away. I should have almost been in number six. And the lesson is if you're in single rider, get there quick. But it was really good. It was so good to do that first thing as well. So that's now ticked off our list for the day. I showed this in the last vlogs when I was here. I really like that. It's so nice. And they've got ears as well that go and look how lovely Minnie is. It is beautiful. Just looking at the Food and Wine Festival food booths. They're just starting to open and it's a very good use of your snack credits at the festivals. Either this one, Flower and Garden or um Festival of the Arts. They all have food booths and some of the items, I mean, in this case, a lot of these are actually quite reasonably priced. Um $7 is the most expensive, but some of them are like $9 something of the snacks, which is a very good use of your credit. As we go around, we'll show you some of the other menus. I just love how each of the booths look as well. I love this grease one. It's always really pretty with the flowers at the front. And another of the most beautiful pavilions is definitely the Japan pavilion. Yeah, the trees are beautiful. Like look, I mean obviously that is big, but it's like a bonsai, isn't it? And then you've got the bamboo in the background. It just looks how they've raaked all of this. So good. And just up here next to this bit, you've got the shaved ice, the khaki gori, I think it's called. And on a hot day in World Showcase, it is honestly the best thing. You just see it on the approach here. And they have various different flavors. You can get ones with like sweet milk and coconut cream. They have pineapple cream, strawberry cream and mandarin orange. Those are all toppings you can get. I usually get the rainbow one just like the regular and it's so refreshing when it's hot. Honestly, it's just the best thing. So, just stopped off at Joffrey's the kiosk here to get a drink and we went for this mango peach refresher. It's actually got coffee bean like extract in it. So, it does have some caffeine but it's not it doesn't taste like coffee at all. It's almost like a monster kind of an energy drink kind of. So, it does contain caffeine because I wanted coffee really, but I was like, \"Oh, actually, this is perfect combination.\" It's like a nice cold drink with caffeine in it. This is a nice little spot as well to come. And it's got a tiny bit of oat milk in it as well. I'm pretty sure it Yeah. But just the tiniest bit. It's like the peach iced tea, but even nicer. Yeah, it is nicer than just normal iced tea. It's so good. I can highly recommend this. And they also had a butterscotch cookie crunch. um like Frappuccinoy type thing. And a lot of the Joffre ice brew. Yeah. And a lot of the Joffrey's locations have different things at each of them because there's several of these around the World Showcase. You got this one, the one near Canada, and one um near Mexico. So maybe they all have something different. Next time we're here, I think I might try that cuz it did look really good. Just on the approach to Italy now. I love this pavilion as well. We really wanted to do Italy this year, but this year kind of got away from us. Paul and I this year obviously moved in together and we've had lots of other stuff going on. So, we just haven't really gotten around to it. And next year then we definitely are like, \"Right, we need to do these other things that we need to do. One of which is going to Italy.\" So, definitely going to be doing that. I'll be vlogging that over on my other channel, Victoria in Detail. I do have another channel if you guys ever want to check that out. It's much more my day-to-day stuff. Not as exciting, but a lot of you I know do watch and enjoy that as well. I'll link it below in case anyone's interested in that. That's interesting. The friendship boat is over at the dock in Italy, and I've not seen that side running for a really long time. Normally, it's just the one that goes from Morocco across, but that one looks like it's operating, which is really exciting. This looks nice. Pizza dough, pepperoni, mozzarella, and tomato sauce. And that looks nice. Like a little twist. You would definitely like that. Yeah, I actually probably would like the tortillini. I mean, I'd like that, too. And that looks lovely. Yeah. Oh, actually, they all look quite nice. And we will of course just go into the caramel store when we were in Germany to show you what they've got in there. Oh my word, are we going to get that thing? The apple thing. I think we need to. We did see an apple crumbly type of thing that was on Disney food blog. I think I was telling you in the last vlog. So, we'll check that out as well. They everything in there is good. You anything you pick will be good. This is where we really need the smell. Yes, we do. I wish you could smell the caramel store. It's always really worth taking a look at the model railway that they've got here as well. It's like a whole village going on. I'll see if I can zoom in cuz you can often see the little flags in the town square that say food and wine festival on them. Look, that's really cute. So, they're having their own little food and wine festival there. The funniest thing is when a bird lands in it cuz it looks like a giant animal attack going on. It's actually really neat. It goes all the way up there as well. We made it into Germany and I actually think this is one of the most beautiful of the pavilions. They all are. But this one looks so good. And this one has the best smell out of the lot. Oh, it does. Which is coming from here right here. We're Oh, I can smell it already. We're getting drawn in. It's like a tractor beam. It draws you in. This is a good time to come in cuz I can probably show you what they have in the cabin. It can be quite tricky to see. The carrot cake cookie, which is absolutely delicious. And what is this one? That looks like a blonde version. Never seen. Oh, they got a chocolate cookie sandwich thing. The caramel apple crisp. is definitely on the agenda at some point, but we're not really hungry yet. No, I'm not really ready for it yet. Maybe we can come back a bit later. They got the caramel apples with the lady hosen on. And they got some Halloween ones. And that thing that looked like a blonde version is a caramel snicker doodle cookie sandwich. Just going to go and say hi to the teddy bear friends. I love this store. They got so many different ones. They do the sty bears in here, which is a very famous brand of teddy bear. They're so soft. This hedgehog is so cute. And they're kind of pricey. $28.99. That's not terrible. I really really like this is the problem when I come in here. I make friends and I want to take them away and I can't. Got a seal as well. Oh, look at this mug. It's got the wicked queen on one side and Snow White on the other. Look at all the detail like the animals and everything. And it's pink on the inside. That's really nice. This range is nice. They got the mug here. This is a blanket. That's really nice, actually. The blanket. That hanging plaque is actually really nice. I've heard good things about this South African cream lure chocolate mousse. They also have Dole whip in a cone. And at this location, they do have the watermelon doll whip. I have had that before over at Typhoon Lagoon, and I really loved it. Here's the friendship boat going. And I really have not seen it doing this little route from Italy going around this way for such a long time. I mean, I'm talking years. I have not seen that now. Maybe it started a while ago and I just haven't noticed, but for a long time it was only the Morocco side and as you can see the sky has completely cleared now. I think we might nip in to see the China film if it's going. I think it probably is. I think they've reopened the entrance as well because that was closed for a while and you had to go towards the exit in the shop to get in. So, let's go and investigate that. I just love this entire area. It's so beautiful. I'm so happy this is reopened because I love it in here. I love coming in here as well for a little sit down on the benches often if I need a break and then you can just go into the film cuz it continually runs all day. So, I've really missed this bit being open. This is where I like to come and sit down. There's all these benches and the show is just in there. And yeah, as and when you're ready, you can go into the next one whenever that comes up. But in the meantime, there's plenty of room, so you can just chill here. It's normally very quiet as well. It's a really good escape in Epcot. A lot of Epcot can be quite busy, especially as you get later on in the day in the afternoon, evening. So, this place is just perfect for a break. We have come to get school bread. Yeah, baby. Cla loves it. It's one of her favorite things. And you were introduced to it last time we were here, weren't you? I was. So, I've only ever had it once in my whole life. And I've thought about it so many times throughout the years. Delicious. It is really good. You look so pleased then your school bread. Cla had the most like happy look. I'm going to hold it up and Claire is going to cut it. Look, it's the school bread. If you've never had this, it's delicious. It kind of looks boring though in a way. And it doesn't even sound like super exciting, but it is so yummy. I've honestly thought about it so many times over the year. Dreams about school bread. What do you do? And I got a frozen cappuccino that they do here. I asked if they did coffee and they do regular coffee but no kind of lattes or anything, but they have the frozen cappuccino and you can have little sprinkly things with sauce in it which looks amazing. This tastes more to me like a frozen hot chocolate. CLA really doesn't like coffee so I was going to say to her to try a little bit but because she really doesn't like coffee I feel like her reaction might be not good if she hates it. I can try it. I don't drink coffee. So, like really really don't. You're not a fan. Okay. But to me, it just tastes very chocolateaty. But you'll probably think it's gross. You don't have a coffee hit immediately. But it definitely tastes like coffee. It's there. It's 100% there. But it is quite, isn't it? Kind of. Yeah. But the coffee definitely overrides the chocolatiness. 100%. It's so funny. Someone who loves coffee and someone who hates it. To me, I can barely taste the coffee. Claire really can taste it. I would hate normal coffee, but then I also really like Do you remember like Cabri's used to make roses and they did the coffee cream? I like that. So, I I like some coffee flavored things, but I don't just like coffee. So, that is If you bought that for me by accident, I probably could drink it and not be grossed out. Yeah. But I would never buy that myself. No. Here is the cross section. This is the best thing about school bread. Look how that goes all the way down through the middle. It's just custardy yumminess. I love it. Look at this. Now I've got a hold of it. Look how much is in there. Do you know what it really reminds me of in the UK is a custard slice. Mhm. Cuz it's got the kind of icing on top. It does have desiccated coconut which some people don't like. Really good. It's been around for years as well. So hopefully they never get rid of it. We're just walking through the Odyssey Center which is set up like the Muppet Lab. This is where we came last year, didn't we? Actually. Yeah. Yeah. So, you come in here to obviously just sit, have a drink. They have some of the festival items in here. The frozen pomegranate and raspberry tea is what we had last time. There is no way on earth I could bring myself to drink that. Pickle milkshake sounds gross. It does. You get fried pickle spears. And those are the chicken wings you can get. I think like all of this sounds okay. I could potentially try all of them. Not this. I would love that. Spicy Carolina Reaper pepper curry wings. You're going to love them. And the fry basket, which is over here. This is a very popular booth for the festival. You get like a little trio of fries. Sea salt and malt vinegar, truffle parmesan, and sweet potato casserole fries. I have had them before and they were very good. And we're just going to head into Creations Shop while we're waiting for our reservation at Gio82. I'm so excited to see what it's like in there. And let's go and look at some Epcot merch, which is always a good thing. It's a great thing. Last year they had so much amazing merch. Yeah, they did. So, like it could be bad for your wallet, but it it's just great to go and have a look around because Epcot's amazing. And if I do ever buy merchandise, it tends to be Epcot stuff. You know, the square bag we were looking at yesterday, they've got this really cute figment version. He's embroidered on there. Let's check out the mug section. Like I've said previously, I think if I bring any more mugs home, Paul might lose his mind because we do have a lot. Oh, they've got this one back again. When I bought this one, loads of you guys really loved it and then they stopped selling it, but it is back again. So beautiful this one. It's got the design inside as well. Love that. Look at this figment one. That's really funny. Not the most practical to drink out of maybe, but I do like it. Just met some lovely subscribers there. Say hi to you guys if you're watching. I've met so many of you the last couple of days. It's so nice. And we also talked to a couple at the bakery as well while we're in Norway. So hello to everyone who said hi today. And this is the bag version of the ears that we saw the other day. This really kind of soft um knotted what's this like a platted design. I quite like that because it's autumny, but it's not specifically Halloween. So, you could wear that anytime. They have like a Muppet Lab food wine festival lug bag. I love this. How much is it? $65. I love it cuz it's got beaker on it, but this would just not be big enough for me. Oh my gosh. Look. Beaker is in the beaker and it's got like bubbles. I'm not sure if this is a bag though or like a lunch bag or something. See if I can open it. Oh yeah, it's insulated. So I guess this is like a lunch bag. Oh, I love that. We are out of creation shop and we're going to go back in there because I was talking to lots of lovely subscribers. So we'll go back in to show you more of the merchandise, but it's time for our GO82. Oh, it's exciting. Yeah, I know. I'm so excited. And I'm not actually sure how you get in. So this is going to be interesting cuz I'm not sure where the entrance is. is in there because I can see the lights on. Yeah. Look, they almost look like Mickey's, don't they? Depending on where you're stood. Yeah. It says the west entrance. So, we're going around and at the moment where the bubblegum wall is is all closed off because of the ride being shut for refurbishment. This is it. Very excited. Oh, it looks good. [Music] [Music] So, I'm going to show you the rest of the place in a minute, but we just want to look at the menu first. And look how fancy this menu is. It's very posh. And inside, it's just saying about a cocktail key. So, different types of glassware. I obviously don't know enough about cocktails cuz I wouldn't have known any of that really. And then on to feature cocktails. We're a bit freaked out by the thought of a caramelized leak martini. That actually sounds a bit gross. I'm not martini. Describes it as savory. I don't like the idea of savory as my drink. I don't really like martinis, so I really don't think I would like that at all. Um, they've What does this say here? Strawberry and coconut right hand coconut cartel rum kari lure kpano antika formula sweet bmuth and strawberry. That sounds more like what I'd go for probably. Yeah, that does sound good. They are quite pricey. I'm just going to warn you guys. These drinks are like $25, $26, $28. So, between like 25 Well, one of them's 23 there. So, between 23 and $30 for a drink, which is up there. Then you've got zero proof cocktails. That's more my speed. Um, Manhattan in the morning, a zero proof take on the traditional spirit forward cocktail and a walk through the garden. A baceious and vibrant, a perfect way to cool down. So, they sound good. You got beer selections there, wine, and then they do have small bites. I think we will order something just so we can show you. A canolini hummus, which comes with um I think different breads. Then a fungy flatbread, which is what I think I'll probably get. I've just taken a little wander over here because somebody has uh vacated this table. I didn't want to come over when people are sat here, but this is the view out of the windows. I can see all the way down to the America pavilion. And they do some kind of fireworks package here with drinks and food where you can see Luminous. I bet that would be amazing. So, just to show you a bit more what the whole lounge looks like. And all of the chairs are slightly different. We're sat in these kind of bucket chairs, would you call these? And they're really, really nice, actually. And there's a cushion behind it. I am living for this back cushion. I'm showing my age there. It's very, very comfortable. And you can see the bar there. And there's bar seating. I just love the light fittings that Cla pointed out when we were walking up here. And then they have various booth seating as well. And then you've got chairs over by the window with that view. That would be such a nice place to sit in front of the window. The vibe in here is like it's fancy. It's really nice, but everybody's really casual. Everyone's obviously in their park where so it's not like a super posh situation, but very very nice. It's like finished very nicely. I think that they've themed it perfectly. Our drinks have arrived and we were just trying to say the name of this drink cuz it is quite long. It is the Let me find it again. Yeah, Cla's gonna find it on the app. It is called the peach shrub whiskey smash. Peach shrub whiskey smash and it comes along with this little biscuit. It's a housemade biscuit and it's got mascapony and peach almost like a jam on top. So that comes along with the cocktail which is really cute. And I love these glasses. I'm very very tempted to get either the wine glass or the tumbler. I might wait until me and Paul come here because he wants to come and try this out as well and we might buy them then because they are kind of pricey but very very nice. There is definitely something it reminds me of that I've eaten or drank before but I don't know what it's not too strong with the alcohol cuz that worries me sometimes with um cocktails. They can be extremely strong. That's really nice. Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't know what the taste is, but it is. You can tell it's definitely not too alcoholy cuz you didn't make that horrible alcohol face. Yeah, some drinks that I've had, some cocktails that I've had have been like extremely strong. Um, this one isn't. It's I taste the peach. It actually almost does taste a tiny bit banana to me, but that might just be my like taste buds. And then try the little biscuit after you've had a sip. It's like stuck to the thing. Yeah, I know. M. That's nice, isn't it? That's really nice. I will say with the menu and the cocktails, I asked which ones were not too strong or were a bit on the sweeter side. This one really that we had, the peach one, is the only one that was on the sweeter side. A lot of the others were more like savory or very strong or quite bitter kind of flavors. And I did notice that that was kind of the theme of the menu. But you can get other drinks. They have a full bar. So, if you don't want to have one of these cocktails and you just want like a regular drink from the bar, you can totally do that. If you just wanted a Coke or a Sprite, I'm sure you can get that as well. But we wanted to try one of the special drinks that's just for here. Cla's just been looking up about the firework package thing that they have. So, she's going to tell us. When I typed in Gio, it then does come up. I saw the firework experience, which I obviously didn't realize. It's got quite a nice picture. I don't know if you can see that. It almost looks like an afternoon tea like set up. Yeah. So, I wonder what it says. Um, end your day in a dazzling way with light bites, sparkling sips, and seated fireworks views at the adult exclusive lounge. Advanced reservations are required. And obviously, you've got to be like 21 and up. But this would be a lovely place to sit and watch the fireworks. So, you'd have such a good view. This place is over 21s only. Children are not allowed in. And also, I didn't bring my passport or anything, and I don't have my driver's license or anything, and I luckily haven't been asked for my ID. They did ask downstairs. They did ask downstairs. So, then I was a little bit worried that I wasn't going to be able to have anything. Not that I'm actually bothered about drinking alcohol, but maybe bring it just in case. I would if I were you. Yeah, cuz they did ask and she said, \"Oh, they might ask you upstairs.\" We were We were fine. Um, but it does sound like that might be routinely something that you might need. Yeah. And then you'd be disappointed if you actually wanted some alcohol and you couldn't have any. You'd be like, \"I'll take a Diet Coke, please.\" It's actually funny. I was talking to Claire about this. I remember when I first started coming to Disney World, bearing in mind I was 19 the first time, but over the years, even when I was like in my 30s and stuff, they did used to be stricter on asking for ID. Thank you. Thank you so much. That looks so good. Thank you. Yeah. So, I do notice that it's not as strict on ID and I don't think that's just because I'm older. I've just noticed that they're not as strict as these because I look super old. It's that's not it. I'm not deciding that's why they don't ask me anymore. Although it might be. So, anyway, let's give this a try. That's really really nice. Yeah, that is good. It's got kind of a bit of a sweetness with like balsamic with these onions, but the cheese is really This is like very good. M. It has got like a really rich savory flavor though as well. That is 10 out of 10. I love that. So, we've just received our check and it's 7136. So, for what we had, two drinks and a little flatbread, it is pricey. We knew it was going to be. I do think though it is a special experience. This is not something that you do every time you come to Epcot. And I actually think it would be worth coming for the fireworks experience if you're going to do it. Definitely. Like at nighttime that would look super cool. If you were sat in one of these tables at the window, it would be a really cool experience. Like a Yeah, definitely a special experience. Not something you want to do all the time. It's a special one. I think every single seat in this place would have a good view of the fireworks though as well. It's not just maybe people were like stood up and in the way. Like even if you were sat behind someone, you could edge back or forward a little bit because there's not there's not like too many people in the way. Even people sat at the window are really low down like the windows are so high and obviously the fireworks go high. So yeah, you'd be able to see everything perfectly. I will try and put on the screen how much the fireworks experience is cuz it didn't say it obviously on the menu that we have. So I'll try and put it on here or I'll find out and let you know. But it's definitely worth coming if you're a Spaceship Earth fan, which I am. You guys know that I absolutely love a spaceship path and especially with it being closed at the moment. I feel like we've had a little Spaceship Perth experience. Um, even though we've not got to ride it. I think Cla's looking up the firework experience. Yeah. So, I just found it. It says that this experience is $179 per person tax. Quite a lot. That is more than I thought it was going to be. So, with that in mind, I may retract what I just said. Maybe you should come in the data. Maybe actually if you do want to do it without it being too expensive. It does say on the app like under the fireworks it says fireworks are not guaranteed as part of this experience. So they may well be like rescheduled or cancelled. You are supposed to take charge of that yourself. Like that is your responsibility to check whether or not there's a reason why the fireworks might not be on. So you I don't think you'd get your money back. Looking at how much things like after hours events and Halloween party, Christmas party, knowing that that's what the cost is, I actually don't think that that would be worth it. That's true. Because yeah, the Halloween party, which obviously we're going to soon, that for me is an incredible experience. It's hours long. You can go on rides. You get you get so many different types of entertainment. This would just be sat in the bar watching the fireworks. But yeah, maybe just come here in the day and enjoy it like this. I think that is going to be it for us here at GO82. Absolutely loved it and I would highly recommend coming here at least once to experience it. Like I said, I probably wouldn't do the firework thing at that cost. If you want to do something special, then absolutely go for it. But you can definitely just get a reservation, have a couple of drinks, an appetizer, and yeah, if you're a Spaceship Earth fan and an Epcot fan, I feel like it's a must to do it at least once. Yeah, I think it is special. Yeah, it is. And it's such a beautiful view up here. They do have some very fancy bottles of alcohol in here. They were telling us a lot of these have been signed by the actual companies that kind of make these drinks, which is very cool. Look at that one up there in a special box. Bunny. I love when you see bunnies. Okay, we're going back into Creations Shop cuz I feel we weren't quite finished with that. They have the bottle version of the mug that I was showing you earlier. Cla's loving this. I really am. It's so nice. It is. It's very pretty. And the words are so true. Yeah. They have Minnie and Mickey, but like the Halloween versions on the create your own character bands. Let's see if I can find Oh, here they are. Can you see them a bit closer over here? Oh, he has fangs. Yeah, Mickey is Dracula. And you've got Minnie in her witches hat. Where? Oh, yeah. There she is. Then you've got um pumpkins up there as well. Yeah. Oh, they're nice. It actually be quite cool just having two pumpkins like that. Yeah, it would. That is really nice. It's $49.99, which with my discount would actually not be too bad. This could be a contender. Ooh, look at this shirt. This really screams '90s to me. That's very, very '90s. It's got a denim collar and everything. I really like this sweatshirt. It's got a mini kind of on the back, but the back of her. And then this is the design on the front. I feel like they have some really nice apparel at the moment. This sweatshirt has got a design on it, but it's very subtle. So, you've kind of got the Mickey, I don't know what that is actually called, that technique, but he's kind of raised up in the fabric. And then you've got Walt Disney World embroidered on there. And they have it in a cream color as well. They also have this skirt, which I'm assuming will have shorts under. Yes, it does. I actually really, really like that color. That's a contender. Let's take a photo of it. That one is more expensive, I guess, because of the embroidery. So, that one's $64.99. I saw this in the All-Star Sports shop last night. You can get your very own Mickey pumpkin wreath, the same as the ones they actually have in the Magic Kingdom, and that lights up as well. I would love to have that. It's just way too big to take home. There's a couple of t-shirts here that I really like. I love this one. It's quite a busy design, but it's just got so much going on there. And I also really love that one. It's like a villain's design. I really like that. I knew this was coming. It is pouring. It looked so great when I was in Collections Cafe talking to Paul. It's getting super heavy. Ah, I'm just about to go and meet Cla over by Guardians. It's our return time. Keep everything crossed for Disco Inferno. I just had to tap in and wait in here for Cla because it's raining so hard outside. I think she's coming. She probably won't be happy that she got soaked. Hello. She's changed her shoes. When my feet are dry. Yeah. Oh, it's so heavy, isn't it? It will not change how amazing it is right now. Then we go on guardianship. Absolutely love this attraction so much. Claire's literally skipping onto the attraction. I love this bit as well. It's really relaxing. [Music] Which song are you wanting today? See, my first one was Everybody Wants to Rule the World. So, literally whenever I hear that makes me just instantly go Guardians. But I did really like um Oh, what was the one that we had that you really wanted last time? Inferno. Yeah, that's a good one as well. That's what I want. That's like That's a good one. That's like exciting from like the second it happens. Me and Paul had September, so I really want Disco Inferno today. Yeah. Okay. See, I know everyone loves September, but I'm like I don't think that's as good as Disco Inferno. No, I agree. Actually, I think Disco Inferno is the best. Yeah. What else is that? I ran, I think the other one's called, and Blondie, which the Blondie song. One way or another. Oh, okay. I do like that song. I do like it, but it's not my favorite on this ride. Okay. I mean, it might be interesting for me to have that song on this so that I can just see what that song feels like on here. They are all good, but definitely Disco Inferno is the Yeah, I mean, I know that everybody wants to order. That's not everyone's favorite. But because it was my first, it is like exciting for me. Okay, we're all done. All Guardians, it was so good as always. Although, we did have Iran, which I've never had before. We weren't a fan of it. No, no, it only cuz I don't know it. Yeah, it just was. It isn't the same as something like September or Disco Inferno. To me, the song actually does surprisingly have quite an effect on how much you're buzzing when you come off it. It's an amazing amazing ride. I think it's the best they have here. Yeah, it really is. But it does just take away a little bit from the enjoyment if it's not like one of those like in my opinion amazing songs that you know really well. Yeah. But it was incredible. And we were in row 10 and it actually did feel a little more intense just a couple of times. Yeah, cuz you're like at the back of the like it's like obviously you're in like separate carriages, but it's like you're at the back of the roller coaster and it had that same sort of feeling, didn't it? It sort of felt like we were hanging in the air a little bit more a couple of times as we were going, but it was really good. It was almost more like intense. Definitely my stomach felt a little bit a couple of times, but I don't feel sick or anything now. But no, but um when I got off, I definitely felt like I was shaking. Yeah, it's so good. It is amazing. But yeah, I hope next time because we do have another Lightning Lane for it later in the trip that we get to go Inferno or September or any of the others. Quite honestly, I think that's my least favorite song now. I've I think I've had them all now and it's not raining anymore. So, that was really good timing for the quite warm actually. It is actually really nice. Just as we're leaving, we have started getting a downpour again. So, this is good timing. We haven't got an awful lot done today, but we are coming back here a couple of times. So there'll be plenty of other time for soaring, doing the other rides. Claire wants to do the Moana attraction again, but this is like crazy weather all of a sudden. So we're going to head to Animal Kingdom Lodge again. Oh, inside out umbrella. But we are going to go to Target. And the best thing to do is to get a bus to Animal Kingdom Lodge. If you're going to the Target of Rolling Oaks, which I would recommend, it's really close to Animal Kingdom Lodge. So if you go there on the bus and then get an Uber, it's about $10. If you were to get an Uber from Magic Kingdom or here in Epcot, it would be more like 20 $25. So, it's definitely worth hopping on a bus to Animal Kingdom Lodge and then going. There are a few different targets, but Rolling Oaks is the best one in my opinion. Animal Kingdom's number five. Five is over here. I just like taking little Disney bus rides, and I definitely like saving half the amount on Ubers cuz you got Oh, look, there's a rainbow. Oh, yeah. Look. A love that there's one coming right now. Love that timing. That never happens. No, we've actually had bad bus timing on this trip. Me and Catherine, we were ling out when we came. Every single time we were getting somewhere, a bus was just there. Me and Cla have had the opposite where we've waited quite a lot. So, this was nice timing today. And it's mini. Yeah, I love that. I just got my phone out cuz I can zoom in much more. Look at them. I love them. It's such a cool resort to stay at. Paul was obsessed with staying here. He really was. I can't believe they're literally just wandering around here. Yeah, it's very cool. Like some of the rooms, if you were over there and they were just pretty much right outside, it's just awesome. We are now in Target and I'm going to do this as a separate vlog, which by the time you're watching this will already be up on this channel. So, I'll link it below if you want to watch that. I love a little Target mooch. So, if you do as well, you can watch that vlog. And we will see you back at Allstar Sports. We are back in the room. I'm absolutely exhausted, sweaty, and everything. This is not me at my finest, but I wanted to film an ending to this vlog. Um, it's been such a nice day being in Epcot today. It's my favorite park, so I always have a good time there. I feel like in a way we didn't do loads today. The day went really, really fast. So, we did the breakfast at Air and Compass, went into Epcot, and when we were walking around World Showcase, it wasn't fully open yet. So, we couldn't really do an awful lot as we were going around until we got to maybe like China and then we did do. Yeah, we did that. So, that was really good and that was just a total walk on which was so good um early in the morning. Um but I just feel like the day got away from us. I don't really know what was going on. Obviously, we did go 82 which was so nice. It was extremely pricey as we did say. Um so, I would reserve that for a special occasion. You don't have to have those like $25 cocktails, but they were expensive. And you could see when you walked in all the kind of bottles that they had in the cabinet, they have some extremely expensive bottles of like spirits and things in there. It is just very, very pricey. But it is something different to do. If you've never done it before, I would try and get a reservation just to see it cuz it does look so great. Like we said, I don't know that I would want to pay that much for the fireworks experience. So, I probably would do it, I guess, to see it once, but that is a lot of money. So, I really would say that that would be something special. I don't think I would actually firework. I think that's so much so much better off doing something like the Halloween party or the Christmas party, like you get so much more experience for your money. Yeah. And also, I do think compared to Happily Ever After in the Magic Kingdom, when you watch Luminous, you can always get a good spot pretty much. there's so many places to watch it from that it's not difficult to see it. So, I just think that's such an expensive amount to see it from there. So, personally, I wouldn't go for that, but I would definitely go there to get a couple of drinks and and stuff. And that flatbread was really like good so nice. Um, it's a shame we couldn't do Spaceship Perth. We are going to be back to Epcot to do the new version of Test Track because that has changed. So, we will do that. Um, we also want to do Soarin, Living with the Land and some other attractions and do a bit more of the World Showcase. So, we'll definitely be back later in this trip. And I did go into guest services on the way out to ask about my magic band. A lot of you might remember this one I got in Hollywood Studios when I was with Katherine. It was earlier this year and it's the Cinderella um, anniversary one and I toyed with getting it for ages. The reason I took it in to guest services, it's not working. So, I tried to put it on charge last night and the night before and it did go green initially, but then when I've been around the parks, I did notice and I mentioned it to Cla, it wasn't buzzing when I was near the statues. It wasn't really doing anything and it doesn't switch on if you press the button on the back. It's just completely dead. So, when I went in and asked about it, she fiddled around with it. She spoke to the IT people. What it seems to be, and I wanted to mention this in case anybody else gets this problem, if you plug in the charger to the USB ports that you get in the rooms, either like in the unit that's under the TV in these rooms at All Stars and some of the others in some of the rooms, you've got USB plugs in the lamps, you know, where you can plug in there. She said if you just plug the cable in and then put the Magic Band on it, it doesn't draw enough power and it won't charge it. you actually need to plug the USB cable into a plug to then plug actually into the wall and then it should start charging. And she did it then and there in guest services and it did then go red in the corner and you could see it had started charging. So if anybody else has that same problem um try that. It could be cuz you're plugging it into the USB ports that are around but they are not actually powerful enough and not charging it. I don't know. That's what she said to try. She did say if that doesn't work for any reason, they can look into giving me another charger and stuff cuz these are expensive. Like this Cinderella one, I really did have to think about whether to splurge on it cuz it really was quite pricey being a limited edition one. So, I just wanted to pass that on in case anybody else has that happen. We're going to go to bed now because we are going to Animal Kingdom in the morning and we are wanting to get there as early as we can. We don't need to be there super early, but it's always good to obviously get started as soon as you can. But when you have slightly later nights, it can be a little tricky to then wake up. So, I want to get to bed as soon as possible. We're going to do the safari in the morning. We are going to be meeting up with Becky. So, those Becky fans out there, she will say hi in the vlog tomorrow, which will be next week for you. Um, we're doing Flight of Passage. We want to do Na'vi River Journey. hopefully the Lion King show because I've missed that the last few times and Cla has missed that as well. So, we really want to do that and wherever else happens, wherever else the day takes us. Oh, and we are eating at Tuska House tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. So, we're having like a late lunch there. Also, we're then going to Disney Springs in the evening and we have a candle making class again at Bose. They very kindly invited us to do an autumn candle and we were really hoping after that to watch the new Downtown Abbey at the cinema cuz it comes out literally tomorrow. But I don't know if it's going to be sold out. I tried to book it online from the UK and it just would not accept my card because it was a UK card. So it is possible that the screening tomorrow evening might be full now. But we will ask soon as we get to Springs and possibly do that as well tomorrow night. So lots to come tomorrow. If you did enjoy it, please do give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe because there's so much to come the rest of this year. Huge thank you to everybody who came up to say hi today. We love talking to you all. We met lots of lovely people again, didn't we, today? Yeah, they're always such nice people. Yeah, everyone's lovely. And it's surprising like all of you pop up out of anywhere. Yeah, you do. You're just we'll be you'll just suddenly be there and we love it. We do love talking to all of you. Um so yeah, it's great to say hi. Always do say hello to us if you do see us. And just thank you to everybody for watching, commenting, subscribing, supporting over on Patreon, following on Instagram, and everything that you do. I really do appreciate it so much. I love sharing everything that we can on these trips with you. And I hope you're all having a great day, and we will see you next Saturday for Animal Kingdom. Bye. No, I just [Music]"

      "transcript": "[Music] See her go. [Music] Jack Jacks are for winners. They were pixie dusting us with Moonlight Magic tickets here tonight. So, I'm so excited. I changed my mind. I couldn't do it. I I love the bar too much. Good morning, guys. Welcome to our epic birthday at Disney. So, our family has started this little tradition where the girls have what they call a yes day within reason. It's not like excessive, but I mean, we're at Disney, so it's a certain point of excessive, but it's not like every toy they ask for in the gift shop and everything they want to do and every expensive thing. Like, we're not saying yes to everything. So, you get the idea. But, it's been a fun tradition so far for our family. So, we're taking you along for Lucy's yesterday. We sat down at home, went through all of her rides, all of her things. We have ride kids, so they're very excited. We have lightning lanes this morning and she helped me plan all the things that she wants to do on her birthday. So, let's go have a really fun day. I'm excited. If you're excited, go ahead, click that thumbs up button and let's jump into this birthday vlog. All right, first park up is Animal Kingdom. The most important thing for her for today was to ride Flight of Passage again. She rode it, absolutely loves it, and that is now one of her favorite, probably top five, I would dare say top three favorite rides at Disney World. So, we got a Lightning Lane for that. So, we weren't having to rush this morning. So, we got some single passes, some Molly passes, and we're going to go kick off this day cuz, you know, we're probably going to end up at all four parks today. [Music] Maybe a banshee. [Music] Did you see it? Shaped like Mickey. That's cool, huh? God bless you. Bless you. We are the reality [Music] reality check of the plan. So Lucy and I sat down and we had all these plans and all this stuff. And now in the moment I'm like, we've got all these lightning lanes and I'm geared towards we've got lightning lanes. We need to move. We're going to we got to make our reservations. And I'm like, let's get there. And I'm like have my laser focus on that. But she's wanting to stop and look at random things and explore. And I'm like, but you said you wanted to ride rides and I have lightning lanes and it's like I'm having to take a deep breath. So, I'm sharing this let you know that whether you're planning a yes day or you're just planning your day at Disney, but just always factor that in. And we have time with our lightning lanes. I'm like, we can slow down, but it's also regearing your brain. And it's not that it's like it's not that we didn't have time to slow down. It's that my brain was stuck in this this is the plan we have to go. Cuz I am a type A planner and I'm like, okay, we have a plan. Let's execute the plan that we made. like we worked hard on this, let's just do it. But it doesn't always go like that. And especially with little kids, they're going to see things. They're going to want to look at it. They're going to want to explore. They're going to want to slow down and check out the animals or do whatever. So, just in the moment sharing that for you guys so that you can kind of pack your patience and just we're going to be okay. Everything doesn't have to go exactly as scheduled. And that's honestly where the most beautiful trips happen is you have this loose itinerary of what you're going to do, but then in the moment, Disney magic pops up and you find it in all these little places. So, if I can say anything in this TED talk, just to wind it up. Always have time for that. And also going with the flow because Disney magic is everywhere. It's not just in the attractions. As wonderful and incredible as they are, that's not the only place that there's magic. So, don't forget to find it other places. Yeah, that's my face. Lucy, you see your face down there? Yeah. Yeah. Watch this. Hold on. Watch. It's scanning. Wa. A pink one. Cute puppet. That's like they said on the ground. Real loud. Okay. 1 2 3. All right. Congratulations. All right. Happy birthday. Thank you. Oh my goodness. Which shoulder do you want him on? What's your Banshee's name? Uh, Ber. Ber. I like it. That is a good name. Make it speak. Say speak. Ber, speak. Speak. Banser. Speak. [Music] [Music] identify them from their lip structure. They are going to have a more triangular shape to their lips or see a little spot on their beaks and that's going to kind of look like they're blushing. Hold their breath for several minutes to allow them to do that. You can actually sleep under the water cold color and their horns are pointed backwards to keep them warm. a hammer in a group and a group of chaper is going to be called a dazzle. They're going to be about the same height as a parent. [Music] They use their trunks to help them eat. Helps them breathe and all that pink color. And that's going to come from their diet of brine shrimp. Is that what you were looking forward to? But it's supposed to be pink, not wide. Yeah, they need to eat some more flamingo. Miles away. Five miles. That's crazy, isn't it? But there's another one sleeping. You see it? It's just laying there sleeping. [Music] [Music] These are from eggs. Those are toys. All right. Wait right here. Putt bar initiate now. Hands up. I think you got worse. [Applause] [Music] some wild monkeys. All right, so we got off the Cali River Rabbits with 4 minutes till breakfast is over at Ashley's favorite place, Yaketti Express. I think that's what it's called. Uh, so she ran off to go get us some food and I'm going to go get us some coffee cuz we have not ate or drank anything. It's like 11:00. I'll see you. [Music] Find of the day. [Music] The moment of truth is now. What did we get? Oh, is that the chicken sandwich? It is the chicken sandwich. Yes. And I know you love these. Yum. Fried rice. [Music] Did you go down there? Right there. Going up the big side. [Music] [Laughter] Goodbye Boneyard. Goodbye dig site. Goodbye Donald Dino Mash. My [Music] go. Come on. [Applause] right here. Let me stand in front of the light. Oh my goodness, it is glowing a little bit. That's so cool. We found Bumba. Hello, Bumba. I think he said he's at the dance party. Oh, he may have been at the dance party. That would have been cool. All right, we are wrapping it up here at Animal Kingdom. It is 12:15. We definitely lingered longer than I thought we would, but we are ready to head to Hollywood Studios, which is our next park. I think just in time cuz the clouds are starting to get a little dark. So, we'll see how that goes. But, we've got our rain gear. So, we're ready to press through no matter no matter the weather. But hopefully, fingers crossed, we can maybe hop to Hollywood Studios and it's perfectly blue skies. We'll see. And that escalated quickly. grown or pink donut [Music] park number two and we are here to do a few things that Lucy likes. We'll see what we can get in. It is 108 and so this is where the parameters and the bumpers on the day are coming in is once we're finished here we are going to go back and relax for a little bit because everybody needs it. We had a crazy early morning yesterday, like almost an all day. That's a thing. And so we are going to definitely need some rest. So that is part of our 48 hour trips is we are we do need to factor in a little bit of rest somewhere, but we are definitely not water averse. So I think we'll be okay. Also, it's really nice when it rains cuz a lot of people hit the door. So, if you've not been in a while or you're one of these people that you hit the door when it starts raining, if you can deal with the rain, it's not bad. And usually weight times go down. I might actually have a chance cuz I think we're going to do team scores today. I do best alone. I'm on. You're on daddy's team. So, last time Bella and I together, what we almost beat you or we actually beat you? Yeah, we're by like 10,000. Yeah, that's the goal. That's the goal. We're going to crave it. I'm just going to say it now. I'm going to put the camera away and I will see you guys on the other side with a score report because I do need to focus. There's some things I can do simultaneously. Filming and playing this game is not one of them. I can do it with Buzz. This one I just can't do. So, I got I got to get it in cuz Buzz is closed right now. So, I have nothing to kick his butt on. So, I got to move it over here. So, wish me luck. That was fun. How much did I get? Now we game is over. We're kind of stuck here at the end for a second. So, we'll see how in just a second. I don't know. I'm not feeling optimistic at this point. I talk a big game, but I'm not feeling very optimistic. Stop. Okay. Okay. So, it's a little stuck. So, my score is 1929. And it says on the thing that the best in the vehicle was 1929. Sorry, guys. [Music] No. Mommy won. Team score. We won. High five. I won. We won together. Our team won. Yeah. Hi. So, this is Lucy or Bella, excuse me. Bella and I's team score. So, you know the deal. Jack Jacks cookie to celebrate. What do you got to Jack Jacks? Cuz Jack Jacks are for winners. [Music] Just wait till next time. We're not competitive at all. The Jack Jacks are for winners. Come over here, winner. That looks delicious. Well, we came, we conquered, we got our Jack Jacks. We're kind of pivoting right now. So, I had a lightning lane for Slinky Dog. And so far, that was at 7:00 and that was the earliest we could get it for today. We've modified, tried modifying, had our our magic tool working for us, trying to get it to modify, and nothing has come a become available earlier. So, we are pivoting and heading back for a break, which we needed, knew we needed. Anyway, also had a subscriber reach out and they are pixie dusting us with, sorry, it was crowded there for a second. Um, we they are pixie dusting us with Moonlight Magic tickets here tonight. So, I'm so excited as we're BBC owners, but we bought resale, so we don't get direct perks like being able to do that, and they can bring people with them. And so, we're getting to go. So, I'm so excited. We've never done it before. Like I'm really looking forward to it. Uh it comes with like free snack vouchers and all this stuff. So it's almost like an after hours of event but just for DBC members. So I'm excited. So we're going to do and Lucy's like, \"You're telling me there's snacks? I'm there.\" Yeah. Especially Mickey ice cream. She's like, \"Let me add it.\" So we gave her the option. and we're like, \"Hey, we have the option to do this party tonight or we can still keep with our schedule of going to Epcot and then Magic Kingdom and finishing the day there.\" But since this was available, she's like, \"I'm here. There's snacks. Let's go. Let's do that instead.\" So, we are foregoing our pop back or pop into Epcot for a bit and we're going to double up on Studios today. So, that's the plan. I'm going to finish munching on some of this cookie before we get to the bus and we're gonna go get some much needed rest and relaxation and take a break for a bit. We're back for our infamous midday break. We are definitely needing it. Getting a little tired. Everybody's kind of slowing down. So, I'm like, okay, we need we need to rest. We need to rehydrate. We need to relax for a little bit and then be ready for our fun evening. Also, I have to give a huge shout out to Elizabeth from Two Sisters Magical Travel, and she is actually hosting us for our two nights here at the Polynesian. And I am so excited and also so grateful to be able to work with amazing travel agents. I have worked with some not so great ones before becoming a YouTuber and doing this. And I'm like, I don't know about recommending Disney travel agents cuz if you know when you've had a bad experience, you totally get it and can relate. It kind of makes you nervous to not work with one, but I love being able to find and collaborate with and share with you guys about amazing ones that are so kind, so sweet, and are so excited to help you love Disney just as much as they do and have a beautiful trip. And so, if you want someone in your corner that is wanting your trip to go as beautifully as you do, definitely check out Elizabeth and her company, I will have it linked down below so you can go and check her out. She's got a quote form down there so you can fill that out. She'll send you a no obligation free quote. And the beautiful thing about working with a travel agent is that you don't spend any extra with Disney for booking them. Disney has already factored in a commission for a travel agent whether you book with one or not. So, it's great to have someone on hand that can help with little things along the way that you might need like dining reservations, Biffy Bumpity Boutique, getting a lightsaber reservation, all those fun things. Can I help take the pressure off of you? Someone that knows it and does it a lot. having them in your corner and letting them just kind of work their magic for you and your family just kind of takes a little bit of that pressure off you. And so it can be a huge help along the way. But again, thank you to Elizabeth and also thank you to you guys because I wouldn't get these opportunities to be hosted and stay in amazing, incredible resorts like Polynesian if it wasn't for you guys. And so I just I want also want to thank you because your views, your likes, your comments, your support, your subscribing, all those little things, they mean so much more than you realize that they do. And so I just want to also thank you guys because I'm getting to spend my daughter's birthday at Polynesian and it's absolutely incredible and so it's such an honor and so grateful. So thank you guys. Definitely check out Elizabeth. I'm going to go take a nap postnap. And we have cupcakes for the birthday girl compliments of our travel agent, Elizabeth. She sent these over and had them delivered to our resort. All the princesses on them. That is awesome. Thank you so much. That was such a fun surprise. Did you say princesses on the cupcakes? Yes. Well, I never Are you one blessed girl to wake up to cupcakes? I've never even seen one cupcakes. I know. Which one are you going to eat? You want the Ariel one? Yeah. All right. I vote for cupcakes on the balcony. Oh, the Moana one. That's cool. That's fell off. [Music] M dinner is served. I can't. We are now back out and about full of ohana noodles and the sticky chicken wings. They are so good. If you don't know, you can actually go if you grab a seat at the bar, you can order food, get it to go, and then take it. And we love to go and watch the show in the lobby. The girls can watch TV. They'll come over and snag a few bites. Everybody's happy. We get Ohana food, and it's fantastic. Okay, so it's Monday and it's a holiday. It's Labor Day. And so far, I'm not seeing the horrific don't go to Magic Kingdom on Monday crowds. I think everybody's been taking the advice. Okay, but seriously, where is everybody? Like, there's hardly nobody over here. I'm like flabbergasted. But for real, this is like lower crowds than when we were here earlier or in August. And it was supposed to be like on crowd calendars, it was rated as like a five or six crowd level. This is supposed to be an 8 n depending on the crowd calendar you look at and it's totally not. So that's one thing. Crowd calendars are great but since the pandemic they're not really all that accurate. So I wouldn't base your entire trip around it cuz it's really not up-to-date data. It's not Yeah, they're just not all that accurate. As someone who comes quite a bit, they're they're wrong more than they're right unfortunately. Like if you want to do a certain park on a certain day, just do it. It's not It does not make that big of a difference. This Tiana's wait time is proving my point. Literally, it is 15 minutes. Literally 15 minutes to wait in this actual standby line for Tiana's. That is crazy. Here we go. I didn't get wet. Me either. They did. I love that part. Yeah, the armadillo part. Oh, this is my favorite. Let's go. [Laughter] I like it. Yeah. Haunted Mansion is 13 minutes, which means it's a walk-on. What in the world? Where is everyone? Like, this is insane. And the weather's nice. Like, the temperatures have dropped after the rain. It's actually a cool breeze. It's not super humid that you're like feel like you're trying to breathe underwater. This is nice. I take back everything I said about September being caught. This is not it. Mine train is 30 minutes, you guys. What the actual heck? Heat. [Applause] Heat. Yeah. Woo. Yeah. [Music] So, we have made it back to Hollywood Studios. We literally just missed the bus because we had like three different cast members stop the girls to want to give them stickers. So, we were just like on a sticker parade apparently. Um, but we finally got here, got to meet up with Ellie. So, thank you so much, Ellen, for the tickets. Like, I genuinely appreciate it. So excited. Like, we've never got to do Moonlight Magic. So, this was such a treat for us. So, literally getting pixie dusted by our internet fam was just like so cool. Um, and all of her family was so sweet. So, we have some Lightning Lanes left over. Um, once we decided we were coming back, I ended up being able to keep our Slinky Dog Lightning Lane. So, we're going to go do that. Um, and this seems pretty empty even compared or just like Hollywood or just like Magic Kingdom was. So, that's crazy. Um, I don't know where the crowds are, but I don't feel like they're terrible, especially for a holiday weekend on a on the actual holiday. Definitely not bad. [Music] We're doing it. Woo! Woo! Here we go. [Music] Yeah, boy. [Music] You got a friend in me. [Music] Thank you. [Music] We got our ice cream finally. Yep. That's the thing that we're looking forward to most. Lucy, are you happy? Awesome. Start right here. [Music] [Music] See you real soon. [Music] That is severely underrated. That was cool. That was good. Like that was super cute. I mean, the girls were mesmerized the entire time. And there was so many characters everywhere. There were just that was really cool. I know this is Lucy's birthday, but I think Dean's day entire trip potentially has been made because Darkling Duck is going to be meeting here. I've always seen people meet him at Moonlight Magic events, but I know it's always characters are subject to change and all this stuff. We looked at the pamphlet and he is going to be here. So Dean is so freaking excited. I'm so excited for him cuz he loves Dark Wing Ducks. Like true '8s kid fashion. I mean, who doesn't love Dark Wing Duck? But that's so so fun. So yeah, naturally we're in line for it. I think it's supposed to start meeting in about 6 minutes. It's a decent line. Probably 40, maybe 50 people, but it's I think it'll be worth it. Okay, thank you. Let's go dance at the pajama party. [Applause] Luna likes your tail. [Applause] [Applause] [Music] Damn it. I changed my mind. I couldn't do it. I I love the bar too much. [Music] Woo. [Music] Tonight, our friend and host Mickey Mouse uses his vivid imagination to create magical imagery for all to enjoy. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Applause] [Music] All I got to do is show yourself. Show yourself. [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh no. [Music] I can't Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Some imagination, huh? [Music] [Applause] [Music] just love the vibe of studios at night. It's just the glow. It is literally perfect. [Music] [Applause] Party day equals three ice creams, baby. Let's go. We're getting our tickets. Our admission to the park price gone. We've uh we've already done $60 plus dollars worth of ice cream. We ain't stopping now. There ain't no stopping us. Meow. [Music] Hey, howdy. Hey. My name is Woody and this is where toys come to play. Mommy for the win with the wipes. Always have wipes. [Music] Yeah. All right. I am going to stay it. Here we go. We'll see you in a minute. We're on Mania and I got to win this one. I just I got to win. Place your bets below. Is Ash and Bella taking it or Lucy and Dean? I don't want I'm just going to say it now. We won. I'm just saying it. I'm calling it. Calling it like I sees it. Lucy and Daddy for the win. Yeah. Here we go. All right. 200. Okay. If you hadn't won, it would have been close cuz Lucy got 44,000 and Bella got 40. So, they were 4,000 apart. I got 208 and you got 222 or 229. Mommy, did I beat you did? You beat 4,000 points. It's a good Hey, check this out. These are our numbers. Those are our numbers. Oh, that was a close game. That was a very close game. We're not competitive at all. This is pretty cool. [Music] [Applause] Yeah. Go go go go go. Woo. Yeah. Yes, Star Wars. That's right. No. Really? Really? [Music] Daddy, help me. How could I How could I not do this? They know. [Music] Hey. It's over. [Music] All right, we got to stay stay caught up. Guess what? Mommy's got I need to know. Mhm. Oh my. We have officially shut down our first Moonlight Magic event. Got a to- go cookie. Got a few more coupons. We may grab some bottles of water just cuz we didn't order groceries this time cuz it was our quick 48 hours and I'm like h we could just buy as we go. Probably should have ordered groceries. At least water it would have saved on that. But this is coming in handy. So we're get getting our waters. Then we're going to head out. But this was really fun. This was fun. This was cool. This Yeah, this was really cool. As if we didn't want more points already. This is not helping. Sweet. We've not bought any, but would be really cool. Well, that is going to do it for our big day for Lucy's birthday. We have put in the miles. Did you have a good birthday, baby girl? Yeah. Yeah. What was your favorite part of today? Uh, riding on this Flight of Passage. Yeah. Getting your Banshee. Mhm. Awesome. I wanted these for the whole time. Yeah. The whole birthday. Did you have the best birthday ever? Yes. See, the best part was um getting my banshee. Getting your Banshee. What other part did you like? H I don't know. You seem like you like the ice cream pretty good. Yeah. Got four and I got 30. Yeah. The birthday girl only got how many she wanted. Yeah, you got all you wanted, didn't you? Well, thank you guys for following along with our fun celebration here at Disney. It was a really good day and yeah, just the whole thing. It was perfect. We were able to pivot like it didn't go 100% the way we planned it, but it went amazing and I'm so glad we were able to pivot and do. And thank you again to Ellen for the tickets for the um sorry words it's late moonlight magic event. Um so that was super fun and thank you to Elizabeth for hosting us here at this gorgeous resort. So we've got one more day here at the Polly tomorrow for Lucy's 48 hours birthday trip. We're doing breakfast at Ohana, which is her request to eat with Stitch and the Lilo. So, we're going to do that. But thank you guys for watching. If you haven't already, click that thumbs up button, red subscribe button if you are new, and I will see you right back here in the next one. Bye-bye."

      "transcript": "I I take me home today. Take me out to play sweet. Hey everyone, it is time for a new travel day. I'm heading out to Orlando for 10 nights. Is it nine nights? Nine nights. Actually, it's 9:00 to experience the fall and Halloween season at Walt Disney World. So, we'll be doing the Halloween party. It's food and wine festival in Epcot. We're also going to be experiencing a lot of new stuff on this trip, including GO82, which is the Spaceship Earth themed lounge in Epcot. We're going to be seeing the new Starlight Parade in the Magic Kingdom, which is the new nighttime parade. It's been so many years since we've had a nighttime parade in the Magic Kingdom. I'm so excited for that. We'll also be going to the Beacon Barrel in the Magic Kingdom, which is the new Pirates Tavern. There's so much going on. There's a new Tron overlay right at the end of our trip. We'll be experiencing that, too. There's so much coming up in these vlogs, so please do subscribe if you haven't already and tap the bell icon and then you'll be notified every time a new vlog goes live. Every Saturday at 5:00 p.m. I'm actually having to record this one clip after I got back from the trip. I did have a little disaster a few days in. My hard drive stopped working. Every night after I'm back from the parks, I always move my footage from the memory cards to the hard drive. And about 5 days in, it just stopped working. And when I got back, I tried like a different cable and things and nothing would work. I couldn't get the hard drive to work. So, I had to recover the footage. I was very nervous that I might have lost it, but thankfully I didn't. Other than the very first clip from this travel day. I don't know why that one didn't recover when the others did. So, I did just have to re-record this one little clip. But with that said, let's get on the road and get this travel day started. [Music] We are underway and a bit later than we thought, aren't we? Because there was a massive thunderstorm this morning. Really, really quite fullon and we weren't expecting that. So, we've left a little bit later just cuz we thought driving in that wouldn't be the most fun thing ever. Well, we love a good thunderstorm. Yeah, we do. Not driving in it, though. No. Sitting in bed watching it out the window. Yes, that's nice. That was very nice. Yeah. We figured we'd leave a little bit later, so it's not too bad. And you can't get into the hotel that early anyway, so it's all good. And it does say on the satnav here, traffic ahead. I think that's going to be Stonehenge. Whenever you are driving past Stonehenge, if anyone has done it, it's always always like got really bad traffic and slows down almost to a stop because everybody's looking at it as they go past. I have probably driven past Stonehenge hundreds of times because this route is pretty much the route that it will always take me to go to the airport or visiting family, whatever we're doing. It kind of takes us this way. So, for me, I'm just kind of like Stonehenge. But other people obviously think it's amazing, especially if you haven't seen it before. What are your thoughts? Amazing or overrated? Overrated. I'm going to be very polite and just say overrated. Don't get me wrong, it's very fascinating and I'm not playing down the historical interestingness of Stonehenge. For us, we just see it a lot. So, I guess it's like anything if you live really close to something else that's really cool, um, but you see it all the time. Let us know in the comments. Does anyone live near to something that everybody else just loses their mind and finds really amazing, but because you see it all the time or drive past it every day, you're like, me and so it begins. This is what I'm talking about. Yeah. [Music] What is it about these services? It's actually starting to come down slightly heavier now. And this is the one that reminds me of Twilight. It's got all these trees. And does it not remind you of like the Cullen's house where they they live? Like these trees. Oh my gosh. Now it's really starting to rain. While Paul's waiting for that, I'm going to grab the coffees. Road trip snack. Nachos with the giant cheese and the Starbucks. Talk about how disappointing your taco Bell was. My nach shows were disappointing. The first day that we're in the Magic Kingdom, me and Cla are going to get the creme brulee horse face. He's like, \"Don't tell me that.\" We We can do that. You actually look like you're going to cry. Are you doing that on purpose? Maybe. He's trying to upset you guys watching and make you feel really bad for him. Don't feel too bad for him because he is going in November again. I'm going to wipe my nose now. I was faking it by the way. Yeah, he's not really crying. Not really crying. I'm genuinely upset though and disappointed fact that I'm not going to have a cinnamon bun. Have you just put coffee up your nose? It just Have you ever had that when you tip it and it flies up out the thing? What you meant to do is see this hole here and not this hole here. No, I know, but it just flew. It flew up out of there. [Music] We have arrived. I'm I'll be honest, it doesn't look great. We need to reserve judgment till we get inside. It might be nice inside. I've never stayed at this one before. It is 15 minutes away by car from the airport. That's why I've never stayed in it. But because Paul's dropping me off, it made sense and it was cheaper. But there might have been good reason for that. So, let's see. Let's see. We're right by reception, literally through the door. And here we are. That's quite good, I will say. Yeah, I wasn't sure if there was a lift. So, I did wonder if we'd have to get the suitcase up the stairs. And here we go. It does look like your typical premier in standard kind of room. So, there's a TV, table, and chairs over there. You got a fan, and I don't think there's any air conditioning in this room, but it's not that hot, so we're fine. Tea and coffee making stuff. Standard bathroom. Okay, we've just got ourselves settled in. Don't know whether we're going to go out and do anything. Probably not like away from here, but there is a pub attached to this premier in. So, we might go and have a drink or something. Yeah, it's actually right there. You saw it as we came in. So, we might go and get a drink or something. Um, but we did have a little snack on the way up here. We'll see how we feel. We want to get up quite early in the morning because although the flight isn't until 2, I need time to obviously we want to have breakfast here, get over there, get checked in. A few people had said about Norse maybe taking a little bit longer to check in. I don't know if I've mentioned that actually. We are flying with Norse on this trip for the first time. It'll be really interesting to see because they are a budget airline compared to British Airways and Virgin and the flight was significantly cheaper. When we booked these flights, the total for two of us was £749 for two of us return. And that's inclusive of luggage, check luggage and everything. I could not believe that. Sometimes with or often with Virgin, it is that much for one person. So, we were absolutely flawed about how cheap it was. I haven't had a flight that cheap since before COVID. Um, probably when I was flying with Norwegian, to be honest. Can't wait to show you that experience, let you know what it's like. I'll show you as much as I can, but there are a few things to bear in mind when it's a budget airline compared to under normal circumstances. One of which is they are more strict apparently on luggage. So, we get one personal item, one cabin case or bag or whatever you want to call it, and then your checked luggage, which is 23 kilos. So, that's all pretty normal, same as British Airways and Virgin, but they are just more strict on the size and weight of the cabin luggage. When I've been flying with Virgin and British Airways, I think I mentioned this in my packing video, but very, very rarely do they weigh my hand luggage. Only a handful of times have they ever done that. Normally, they just are not that bothered. Obviously, you can't have anything too big, but they are pretty relaxed, but apparently with Norse, they do check and weigh things a lot more. So, with that in mind, I have gone for smaller hand luggage than I normally would. I've just got this one here, which is a new bag that I got. The Travel Hack is the brand. In hindsight, they do this one, which is the underseat size. So, this will fit like Ryionaire and other airlines where it has to go underneath the seat, but it is really quite small. I do wish I'd have got the cabin baggage size, which is a bit bigger, but you live and learn. This one is the one I'm taking. And then for my personal item, I've got this bag, which is like a cross body. I absolutely love this. This little pocket on the side, I put the camera in. And then I can put my phone inside and you can have your headphones kind of out through that little gap. And this is just going to be perfect for parks and for like the travel day tomorrow. And what I always do when I get here to the hotel the night before, I just check that everything is in the right place. So, you want to make sure your liquids are where they should be. batteries. You need to be careful. You can't have lithium batteries in your checked luggage. They need to go in your hand luggage. So, I'm always just checking that everything is where it should be. I've got my trusty snack pouch in there. I've got the fans. Um, those have got batteries in, so they come in the cabin case. Then, I've got my charger for my laptop. Laptop is in the back. I've got some extra cables and things in there and a power bank. My sunglasses, they're all in there. And my deodorant. You guys will know which deodorant I use because I have partnered with this brand for years now. Probably about 2022, I want to say, is the first time that I used a Wild deodorant. And this is the one that I'm bringing on this trip. I've actually got the rollon and the stick deodorant. This is their new case with Cath Kidston. So, this one has just launched and this is the marble ditzy case. You actually keep the case and refill with the deodorant refills. I've had loads of these, but I have given them to family and friends. So, everybody is now using wild who I know, including Paul. Including me. I got mine as well. He loves animals and animal kingdom. This one had um all the different safari animals on. And you love the thunderstorm scent, don't you? Thing that I love the most about Wild for me is the fragrances. I do normally use the stick version, but I'm bringing the roll on along as well because I really want to try out both in the Florida heat. Nothing is hotter and sweatier than being in Florida, so I really want to see how they both perform. So, I'll use them both. And I need to actually put the refills in cuz I haven't done that yet. So this one which is launching with this case is the wild flower bloom. So this is a really nice floral scent. That reminds me of something. Does it remind you a tiny bit of palmer violets? Yeah, a little bit. Yeah, it's really nice. Putting the refills in is really easy. You just make sure that the case is wound all the way down to the bottom. Take that off. Then you just sit your refill on the top and then wind it up. And then with the roll-on version, you just take the top part off like this. Shake the refill and take the lid off that. And then that just screws into the top. Then back into the case. And then the lid unscrews like that. I love that they started doing roll on because so many people had asked for that when I've talked about world in the past. A lot of you said, \"I only use roll on.\" Both of them offer 24-hour protection and natural ingredients. The roll-on one has no white marks, so if that's something that's important to you, then I would go with the roll-on. And the stick one is more kind of moisturizing. If you haven't already tried it, I would definitely make the switch and give it a go. I have never looked back. I've used it for several years now, and it's now the only deodorant that I use. And Wy would have given me a discount code for you guys, which is 20 Victoria, so that you can get going with this and try it yourself if you haven't already. And if you have already tried it, the 20% off is on everything. So you can get your refills. They also do body wash, hand wash, you can get lip balms as well. All of that is refillable. I absolutely love the refillable body wash and we use the hand wash as well, don't we, at home. So, you can use the code 20 Victoria. There's a link in the description as well and there'll be a QR code here. If you're watching on TV, you can just scan the QR code with your phone and that will take you right to it so that you can place your order. But it's totally worth it. We love it. And then there's you asking me to sniff your armpits all the time. I don't actually sit my armpits, but I do like when when I've put because I put it on at night time and in the day. I don't know if anyone else does that, but if I've had a shower of a night time, I do put my deodorant on. I'm constantly like, \"Oh, can you smell the like which one do you think it is?\" And I'll be like, \"Oh, I smell like oranges. I smell like pineapples.\" Think I'll just put one of these into the case. You actually could put either because the refill for the rollon, although it's a liquid, is below the 100 mil. So, if you wanted to, you could put that one in there. I think I'll just put my stick one in for now and put this one into the suitcase. And then in the morning, I can just throw in a couple of makeup items. I don't take a lot of stuff on the plane with me. I usually just take my concealer, lipstick, and a couple of other bits. So, I'll put those in. And then that's going to be everything for the hand luggage. So, I think everything's where it needs to be. So, we'll probably go and grab a drink now. I think there's a weird noise coming from outside the window. Yeah, cuz that's where the generator. Yeah. We haven't We haven't locked out with location. And we are literally right next door to this big grating thing that is like blowing out. It's like a vent, but a massive one. I picked this one because it was the cheapest. So, if that means that we've got a weird giant vent blowing air out and the bed is on a slight slant, then the bed is on a bit of a slam. It's all good. It's all good. We're in the hotel bar now having an orange juice and lemonade. I love an orange juice lemonade. We know how to live dangerously. Neither of us are really drinkers, are we? We just It's actually called the St. Clemens if you want to be partial. Is it? Yeah. I did not know that. It's not that the song. Yeah. I've just never like known that orange juice and lemonade had a name other than orange juice and lemonade. Oh, we got some knobbies nuts as well. That's such a weird name. Just moved that a little bit cuz it was a bit close. It's actually really super dark in this corner and the camera is doing a reasonably good job not being quite bright to be fair. I've been trying to think of the other things I need to do before a flight. So, I've been downloading stuff to watch. I got ghost. What is wrong with that film? It's so cheesy. It's It's not cheesy. It's a romance. We'll agree to disagree on that. Put it in the comments. What is your favorite film? Cuz I love knowing that. Like people's favorite. My favorite of all time is Apollo 13. Absolutely have seen that. Really good film. It's such a good film. It's a really good film. I'll give you that one. What's yours? Oh, of Why did I just ask that? I know the answer to that. Forest Gump, obviously. Yeah. We haven't checked in yet. Um, you can do online check-in with Morse, but because we've paid for the premium check-in. We basically panic purchased premium check-in for like12 pounds I think it was each because a couple of people had told me that they flown with Norse in the last few weeks and it was super busy at check-in. They waited 2 hours one person said just to do bagrop um and we got really freaked out by it. So we had paid for the premium queue for the check-in. I cannot believe that you this is what he put on the TV as per usual. is like slim pickings on the free view. Paul has put on this Dr. Pimple Popper. That's right. Yeah. I didn't know that this was a thing. So, I don't know where I've been. I don't really watch normal TV. I watch YouTube. I watch crime documentaries, but I don't really watch like regular TV. I assumed that would mean pimples on people's faces. And this person that they're featuring, I was like, they don't have pimples. Like, what is going on? The pimple is not on their face. I will leave it to your imagination where where it is, but I'm assuming in a minute we're going to have the horror of seeing this thing being popped. Is that what's going to happen? She's a doctor who specializes in lumps and bumps and spots and warts and stuff like that. [Laughter] We just saw it. We just saw it. If I see this procedure actually happening, I will perish. Oh. Oh, that's not even a spot. That's ew. Stop. I can't. I can't. Right. That's it. I'm going to bed. I'm going to bed. I can't. I don't know about anybody else, but when you're on the leadup to a trip, I've had a lot of like packing to do. I had the packing video to do. I've had other work to get finished before I go away. It just I just keep seeing it. I just keep seeing it. other work to get done and then then I lay awake not really sleeping that much. This is going to give you nightmares. Why? Well, you wonder why I'm not going to sleep this tonight. It's going to be because of this. So, it'll just be a quick transition for you guys and we will see you in the morning and then it's going to be off to the airport for travel day. I'm so excited. I honestly cannot wait. I can't wait to get over there. There is so much exciting stuff that we're doing when we're over there. I can't wait to go to Beacon Barrel, especially the parade. Um, the nighttime parade in the Magic Kingdom. Like, I just keep thinking about all of this stuff we're going to do and I cannot wait to get there. So, yeah, we'll see you in the morning for travel day. Good morning from the Premier Inn. I have tried to find any angle under this table where I don't look like I'm under a spotlight, but this is just how it is. Let me just try it. Move it a little bit. No, this is pretty much as good as it's going to get. And yeah, we're just having our breakfast here in the Premier Inn. Normally, it's like a um buffet breakfast, but there's hardly any people here. It's very quiet. So, you just say what you want and then they bring it to you. So, yeah, it's not actually a buffet breakfast. If you do want that, you need to always go to like a busy premier in cuz we've had this a couple of times in different places, not just here at the airport where they just ask you what you want, which is fine. And it's cooked to order so it comes out nice and hot. But yeah, if you're looking for a buffet breakfast, definitely stay over at the Premier Inn at North Terminal. We are making good time this morning because I didn't sleep very well last night. So, I got up at a pretty good time because I was just awake anyway. I did fall asleep easily and I woke up at 3:30 and didn't really go back to sleep after that. Um, so I haven't had a lot of sleep, but I just never do the night before. I'm always worried about oversleeping or thinking about what I need to do the next morning or I don't know. You would think when I've done it this many times that I wouldn't still do that, but I do. And uh when I'm in a different bed, I just don't sleep that well. How was your breakfast? Banging. Was it good? Yeah. I love that. That is your like stock answer to like when food is good. Yeah, it was really good. And you told me that you're going to have a turkey leg when we go to Florida. Turkey leg over there. Turkey legs are iconic at Disney. I mean, I you never really see them on my channel because I would never eat one. I think Kate did years ago tried one, but yeah, Paul's going to try one. I wish you were coming on this trip. I'm sad. I wish I was coming too, but again, I've got to work. I know. I know. And it's not long till November to be fair. We're just back at the room closing up the suitcase and just about to put everything in the car. And I didn't show you my travel day outfit yet. Look at my new travel day t-shirt. I wanted a travel day t-shirt that was like a specific me travel day t-shirt. I absolutely love this. And I've done the design in white as well. So, like a white t-shirt with the design on. What do you think? Let me know in the comments. Do you like this? If anybody does really love it, I can probably make them available um on a limited run. So, let me know if you would be interested in one of these and I can probably make that happen. I absolutely love it. Then I've just got leggings, which is always what I wear to fly cuz it's more comfortable. And my pink Jordans, which I absolutely love. Okay, Paul has just dropped us off and I totally forgot to get him to say goodbye to the vlog. So, he said goodbye to you guys. But look, he's here. It's Cla. And Cla is definitely one of, other than me, the most enthusiastic, excited people. I'm so excited. I've been thinking about it for so long. I'm so excited. We are. We can't wait. There's just so much going on. We've been booking our Lightning Lanes. We're going to tell you about all of that today. Um what we've got planned, booked, everything. But we are just absolutely buzzing. Yeah. The Halloween party. That's what I've been dreaming about for a long time. Absolutely. And you want to watch the parade properly this time cuz last time you got a bit caught up. I couldn't cross the road. They've got stuck over on the other side and then the barriers come up. So, yeah, I want to watch the parade properly. Yeah. So, we're going to be doing all of that. But, it's about half 10, I think. Maybe not even past 10. Qu 10. So, we're just going to go in, find the Norse desk, and get ourselves checked in and everything and then head through for a coffee or something. Tea in your case. Well, if we can find a Starbucks. I want to have I had one the other day. I want to have the same drink that I had at Disney last year. I've been thinking about them like all year. That's your Disney drink. That is my Disney drink. Yeah, it's pumpkin cold brew. It's a pumpkin cream chai iced pumpkin cream chai latte. I looked it up on the vlog from last year. We're going to go and try and find one. So, let's head in. [Music] I think we're in the right line for the premium check-in. We're not flying premium, but we paid for the priority queue, which I think is this. So, we'll see. [Music] Just having a little freshen. You have to have a little freshen because it does get a bit sweaty in the security queue. So, you know, got to freshen up after. Although, I will say the security was so fast. You don't have to take laptops or liquids out anymore. So, that is obviously now a permanent thing, I guess. And I didn't have to take shoes off. There was some slightly different scanners, actually. Normally you go into this little pod and put your arms up. This was more open and you just left your arms down but like outwards. I reckon it'd be better for people who don't like feeling in any way claustrophobic cuz it was just like a thing that you stood in front of. Your arms up and you got sweaty arms. That's very nice. Sometimes people have sweaty. I mean I don't because of my wild deodorant which by the way CLA now uses as well. Don't you? Yeah. CLA's now into it. Everyone's into it. Paul uses it. We all do. Um, but yeah, the security was actually really, really easy, really fast, and we breeze straight through. So, we've got So good. So worth spending that extra little bit of money. Oh, the £12 that we paid for the premium check-in, 100% I would do that again. Like, we didn't have to wait at all. And we had a nice chat with the lady on the desk. Yeah. And then there was quite a big line for the other queue, so totally money well spent there. Definitely. Our gate info is not till 1, so we can go and discover where Starbucks is. Cla is really excited for her autumnal pumpkin drink. So hopefully we can go and get that. We've had our coffee. Cla has had her Was it exactly what you Yes, it Well, they don't actually make it anymore, but they seem to still do it. Okay. So, I'm happy with that. And it was it was yummy. Nice. Good. Good. So, we're going to go and just grab a sandwich for me for the plane and have a little wander and then it'll be time for eight. [Music] Okay. Why do I really want this? This is really cute. Well, that all went pretty quick. It is time to go to the gate already. Gate 34. That did go quick. It did go really, really, really quick. I feel like I haven't logged anything. It's already time to go on board. And the BA flight is gate 33 and ours is 34. So, they're right next to each other. And they both leave at 2. So, that was confusing. We had to make sure. Yeah. Well, you're right. I was like, \"Wait a second.\" Two at the same time. [Music] I'm really excited to see what Norse is like, let you guys know. We'll try and show you as much as we can. Obviously, it's a little bit tricky sometimes filming on the plane. I don't want to get other people in it, but we will show you as much as we possibly can about the experience because it is significantly cheaper most of the time than VA. So, we will see. [Music] got the usual gate craziness cuz there is the BA flight and the north flight. [Music] We've got a seat next to us and nobody's in it yet. Fingers crossed. This happened to us last time. Look at my nails. Yeah, Cla has bought. Let me go and get this close up. So, we've been going about an hour and 45 minutes. We just worked out. We were hoping it was longer. It feels like longer. Yeah, it does feel a bit longer. And um so we got 6 hours 42 minutes left. We just wanted to talk about the food. They did only have one choice left, which was salmon. And Cla did not want that. Um so they gave her the box cuz it's box rather than trace. They have lots of bread. So we just wanted to show you what you actually get. So you don't get like a little side salad or anything kind of nice like that that you sometimes get with the other. Yeah. Sometimes you get like crackers and cheese crackers and cheese. And also like a little like sometimes you get a pot of orange juice or something sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. So they don't have any of that. But then we could get like a Coke. Yeah. So if you have the meal, they do bring a drink. So we both got a Diet Coke and you can order stuff as well. If you go onto your screen, they have this marketplace section. And if you go to this cafe section, there's actually quite a lot of stuff that you can buy. I would recommend buying your own snacks before you come because this is obviously more expensive, especially for things like this, like muffins and chocolate and stuff that you can bring with you. But they do have a couple of options that are more like a meal. If I just scroll through here and you can see the prices. So like these Mentos are like $3 um $4 for a small thing of Pringle. So it is expensive more so than if you bring it yourself. But if you go down through here, so they do have a like curry you can get would be $1350. Toasted sandwich, which is $1050. Some sort of veggie pizza thing, $8. So you definitely can get something um to eat if you haven't booked the meal. There was chips as well, wasn't there? Yeah, you can actually get fries, which is so random. So $6 for some fries. I actually would eat those if I got hungry. I probably would. I think the lad next to me had something like that. Yes. Yeah, the person next to us did. Oh, by the way, there is someone sat next to us. So, it's very full on the flight. By the time we were taking off, pretty much every seat was taken. But yeah, so you can order things like this. And if you did get package later on, at least there's options. The pasta, I think, comes in like a little pot almost like Yeah. And then get noodles as well. And then you can order cups of tea and coffee. Bear in mind, they will not serve those when there's turbulence, but the seat belt sign has just gone off, so I might order tea. Um, and then they bring a machine to you. So you can just tap I think contactless to pay for it. So that's how you pay. They just bring it to your seat. This in way is actually nice that you've got this whereas you don't have this on Virgin and British Airways. You kind of I mean they will always give you a snack if you need it. But I actually think it's quite cool that you can order these things whenever you want. But just bear in mind it is on the pricey side. Yeah. But you know it's not too bad. Later. Time for another cup of tea to pass the time. We're just spacing out cups of tea basically to have time. We're feeling tired now. Sleepy. I did doze off a tiny bit. Um, and I did that thing where I went like this. Yeah, you did do that a couple of times. Yeah, I can always feel that I've done it. There's not a lot to do around here, let's be honest. I've been looking around. It's really funny. Literally like everyone is snacking and I know I feel like I've eaten loads just because it's something to do. Yeah, I've eaten so much more than I would eat in a normal day. Me too. It is now what did we just say? 2 and 1/2 hours. 2 hours and 29 minutes. Okay, that's not too bad. It has been fine though. No complaints really. Certainly for the price. Yeah, it's comfortable. Like there's no issues with any of that. So, we will talk about that when we get there. But apart from that, I've had a few little walk around, stretching, napping, snacking, watching the teeth. That's about it. We've just secure babies using the seat belt we have provided. Thank you. We've just got to turbulence, so we probably won't get our cups of tea now. I was pinning a lot of excitement on that cup of tea. Finally, we're less than an hour away. I cannot wait to get off the plane now. It's just felt really long for some reason today. I do this flight a lot. Sometimes it feels really fast, other times it feels slow. And today it kind of has. [Music] We have arrived. That took a while. It took a while. It did. We were an hour um waiting to get through from our baggage and stuff, so that did take a minute, but Yeah. Well, and your suitcase took quite a while. It took longer than mine to come through, so that was a bit annoying. So, we're a bit tired now, but we're good. We're right by the Mia's desk, which is you come down in the glass elevators. Let me just spin this around. There you go. And the desk is over there. So, it's very easy. You just kind of walk out through immigration down in the glass elevator. And Mia is down here. And we are just about to head over. There's not many people waiting. So, fingers crossed that won't take long. But it's already quite late, isn't it? What time? It's half past 8. Oh, that's not too bad. But we'll probably get a refillable mug. Um, I just really want some fruit, I think. But I don't really want a big dinner. And then we will get to our room and unpack. Waited about 10 minutes there for Mia's connect. That wasn't very long at all. We feel that warm air. [Music] We made it. And what time is it? What time do we arrive? 9:30. So that's not too bad. Actually, that could have been a lot worse considering how long things were taking. So, we're going to get checked in, grab our refillable mugs. Oh, it's so nice to be here after such a long day. It's so nice when you actually arrive. We're all checked in and we're in the touchdown section which is not too far from here. So, that's really good. We're in a preferred room and we're just grabbing a couple of things here. And all I've grabbed is my refillable mug and some apple slices. That's all I fancy. I don't really need anything more than that. But definitely I wanted to get a refillable mug, especially if our room is closed because then it's easy to just pop over and grab drinks. I've gone for the pink this time because I'm trying to collect all the different colors. [Music] Oh, it's a bit warm in here. I am so tired. Yeah, me too. This is the travel day look that Claire is sporting. Yeah, this is this is like 20 hours of awakeness. Yeah. If you know, you know. If you've done a Disney travel day, it's exhausting, but totally worth it. Oh, yes. [Music] And it was funny the uh it says us up there. Yeah, it's got your names on the TV. I love that when you walk in in the Disney music and the cast member actually said, \"If you walk in and there's only one bed, don't be alarmed. There's a pull down bed.\" Obviously, I've stayed here before, but Cla just walked in and said, \"I can totally see how somebody might think, wait a second, there's only one bed.\" We are done for the evening. We got here later than we thought as you saw and we've just unpacked everything and I did some ironing as well of things that I want to wear tomorrow. This vlog is all going to be one big vlog of travel day and Magic Kingdom tomorrow. So, keep watching because as soon as this little bit is done and a quick transition, it will be the morning and you guys will be coming with us to the Magic Kingdom for our first day. I just wanted to very briefly tell you a little bit about our thoughts of Norse and the flight and how that was. I'll start by saying it was absolutely fine, wasn't it? So, for what we paid, the actual flight itself was normal. You know, the odd little bits of turbulence, it was just normal. Everything was normal. It was very busy, enough, comfortable, toilets were fine, leg room, all of that. So, everything was good. The main thing that I would say is it is a very different experience. So, what you don't get with something like Norse versus Virgin Atlantic is the experience. So, with Virgin Atlantic, when you're boarding the plane, the cabin crew are kind of all there so friendly. And when you sit down, you've got kind of music playing, haven't you? And the um safety demonstration video and Oh, yeah. Cuz where I was sat, I couldn't actually see them doing the you know the like sort of saying, \"Oh, you pull down and put the mask over your face and all that kind of stuff.\" I couldn't actually see them and there's not a screen up for you to like see it happening and like there wasn't there just wasn't enough people cuz I'm only little and I was like just obviously sat too far back from the needed more people and there was no video on the screen like there is with Virgin have got that funny little cartoony thing going on. And then with Virgin, as soon as you are up in the air, they start coming around with drinks and it's just it's a whole experience. And the cabin crew are very, very engaging and very lovely. When you fly with Virgin, it's not like that with Norse. It's not that they're not friendly, don't get me wrong. It was just it's not the same experience. No, it's so hard to explain. It's No, it's not that like they're horrible or rude or nothing like that. I think it's actually more that it comes across as not particularly friendly, but it's just not warm and hi, how are you or like you know checking on you or anything. It it's kind of a lot more matter of fact. Yeah. And I think that's the reason they don't have the need to engage with you the same as when you fly with Virgin. So with Virgin because they are coming around with drinks all the time and food and um that's and snacks and that's all included in the cost of the flight. So, the cabin crew will be engaging with you regularly when you fly with Virgin. With Norse, they've got no real reason to, unless you're ordering snacks and paying for them and they're bringing them to the seat, if that makes any sense, or maybe like coming through and picking up rubbish and stuff, but generally you just don't really have the interaction with the cabin crew. I think that's what we're trying to say that is different with the experience. The inflight entertainment was absolutely fine, but um you do need to bring your own headphones with a regular Yeah, regular headphone jack. Otherwise, you'll have to pay$5 $5 for a pair. Um, I didn't bother because I had stuff downloaded on my phone. So, I just watched that. Um, I I mean, I happily would have paid the $5. I just there wasn't anything I really wanted to watch more than what I had downloaded for myself. But, just be aware of that that you do need those headphones. If you've got a pair of wired headphones or one of those iFly things where you can connect your AirPods by Bluetooth, um, you can do that. Um, but just remember about that the headphones are not included. The main takeaway that I would say is remember your headphones. Remember to bring all the snacks and drinks that you are going to want because pretty much none of them are included like they are with other airlines. Obviously, drinks you're going to need to wait until you get through cuz you can't bring liquids. So, you will have to buy your drinks from Boots or somewhere. Overall, um, in terms of the cost, I would say we paid half what the cost would be normally with Virgin on average. So, we pay £375 per person return including luggage. So, while the experience is lovely with Virgin, because I travel to Florida a lot, I would rather the flight was half the cost. So, I would 100% fly with Norse again. They do have the option for premium economy. They don't have any business or first or upper or anything like that, but they do have premium economy. And when I flew with Norwegian, I flew in those seats and they are very comfortable. So, you do have that option. In conclusion, I would 100% fly with them again if I'm looking to save some money. If I was looking to do a bit more of a special trip or it was I wanted something a bit nicer, I wanted the experience, I would go with Virgin OBA. What did you think? Would you fly with them again? Yeah, I would certainly for the price. Yeah, the airport experience upon arrival was not great compared to normal. Usually we just breeze through, no problem, especially at Terminal C. Sometimes you wait a little bit for your luggage. Um, but we waited ages for the luggage to the point where I was worried mine wasn't going to come out cuz everybody else had got theirs and moved away. Yeah, it was a big criaky crumbles moment. Where is my suitcase? Yeah. And then watching all the other flights come in and the queue for the like security passport control just get bigger and bigger and bigger. Yeah, it was wild. It basically loads of flights came in at the same time. That doesn't normally happen when I've flown before, but there were like all the carousels were taken up with luggage coming out and then everybody just piled into passport control. It was long. It was long. It was a long time. But once we got through, Mia's was fine. Everything was good and it was pretty much your average travel day. No major crisises. Everything was good. And like I said, tomorrow we are going to the Magic Kingdom and I am so excited. And the cast member who checked us in was great. She was lovely. Yeah. you know you're at Disney the minute you get to a Disney hotel. She was absolutely full of energy, so lovely. And I thought, \"Yeah, this is how you know you're at Disney cuz it's always like that.\" Um, so it was just it's an actual magic bubble that you enter. It really is. It really is. So, and then you walk into your room and you've got your welcome message on the TV and the music which is still going in the background. On the agenda for tomorrow, like I say, is the Magic Kingdom. We have got some Lightning Lanes for Tiana's Bio Adventure. We also have Pirates and Haunted Mansion, I think. Yeah, the other two. We're going to be eating some snacks. We're going to be rope dropping a creme brulee quissant. Woohoo. Um then doing our lightning lanes and Tron we may or may not do tomorrow, but we do have other plans for Tron later in the trip. But for you guys, it will just be a quick transition and we're going to see you in the morning. Good morning from Allstar Sports. We're feeling a bit more bright and breezy this morning. Yeah, much better. But we didn't get a lot of sleep, so we are going to have an earlier night tonight, I think. Yeah. Well, I've already been awake for about 3 hours. It's like 8:20 now. So, I woke up about 5:20. Yeah. We kind of arranged today. So, we've got an early start this morning and then we've got our Lightning Lanes one after the other. Pirates, John's Bio Adventure, and Haunted Mansion. So, we're going to be doing all of that this morning and then we can leave not too late so we can go to Target and all of that and then get back to get an early night. Yeah. Well, I think we need one tonight so that we don't then ruin the whole of the rest of the holiday cuz we'll just be too tired. And yeah, like we're going back to Magic Kingdom several times. Few other times, I think, as well, aren't we? Halloween party and another day as well. So, so at least we're not then missing out, but we'll enjoy it today. Get those things done and then still come back another day. But we don't need to go too hard today, which is is good. And today's outfit, I've got my Rope Drop Club t-shirt on. This is from Magic Maker Ears, and so are the ears. So, thank you to Laura for sending those. And Claire is wearing these are from Magic Mickey ears as well. They are amazing. I love these ears. They're beautiful. And I will leave a discount code for you guys below as well. And I also have her magic make ears. Look at this little bag charm. How cute is that? Absolutely love that. Oh, we got the Dumbo bus this morning. Love that. [Music] Here we go. Love it. There is nothing like the first morning feeling and walking into the Magic Kingdom. You can hear the daffodans. Yeah, love the daffodans. We can't see them yet. We can hear them though. I don't know where they are. I think they're up here maybe. Just Oh, the smell. Do you just go off? Oh, yeah. You did. Oh, yeah. That's lovely. That was like a popcorn smell. When you're waiting for your trip, this is what you're waiting for is walking in the first feeling. It's amazing. absolutely love it. So for breakfast this morning, we really wanted to get the creme brulee quissant and a Starbucks. So we decided to divide and conquer. Cla has gone to get the creme brulee quissant from Gastons. I'm going to go in here to the main street bakery and get the coffees and then we're going to meet up, have those and then start on our lightning lanes. I believe pirates is first I want to say. We'll have a look when we sit down and let you know what the plan of action is. But just walking in here, seeing the daffodans, just getting that Disney feeling, the smell. We absolutely love it. It's so good. Are we busy in here today? No, it's actually not that bad. I've written down what Cla wants for her drink because I don't want to get it wrong. She wants the chai pumpkin thing. This is without doubt the best morning coffee spot. I've got my caramel macchiato. I'm pretty sure these people behind me are doing the Keys to the Kingdom tour. We were talking about that on a live stream recently. The Keys to the Kingdom tour is like an extra thing you can book. It's so good. I haven't done it for a lot of years, but you get to go backstage a little bit. You get loads of facts about different things in the Magic Kingdom. It's amazing. Cla has returned with the Grand Lake Cross on. This is now one of my favorite snacks. Yeah. Well, I'm looking forward to eating it. Oh my gosh, it's so good. In all of the parks, definitely in the Magic Kingdom, but I absolutely do love this. It doesn't look like what you would imagine a croissant to look like. That's confusing. But it has the actual like crunchy creme brulee kind of top on the outside and then the filling. Oh my god. It's just we just need to get into it. CLA's never tried it. I wouldn't love it now. Cut this up. That looks like Have you ever had the Sainsbury's um Madagascan vanilla custard? Oh, yes, I have. That's what it looks like. I kind of want to have a big bite in the middle. But that will go all over my face. Oh, yeah. That's nice. And then with the outside as well. Yeah. It's now one of my absolute favorite things anywhere in Disney, to be honest. M. Yeah. Yeah, I just got a bit more of the like crunchy sugary bit on the top. And that is lovely. It's so good. I've been dreaming about this ever since me and Paul had it. I've thought about school bread a few times. So, I have to have school bread. We should get that tomorrow. Mhm. I also really want to just have a dull whip. I know that almost is like a little bit boring, but doll whips are never boring. It is very good. It is pretty messy. It is messy. Yeah. I think if you gave this to a child, it would be a big old mess. Big mess. I mean, lots of things are to be fair. Whatever you give to children. We're just on our way now to Pirates, but had to stop and give you a little look at the castle. Got some blue skies starting to come as well. It was a bit overcast this morning. But this is just beautiful. I think Cla said she just spotted Donald. And oh, the statues. She's taking pictures of the statues. I thought she actually saw Donald and Daisy. She means these. I love it. I love it. We were just um commenting how many different types of classic mini ears there are. And they have got spots. You can see they have got spots on them, but that's quite nice. It's quite subtle. Oh, and actually there is the sequins with a with a spotty bow and a plain bow. Yeah. So, you've got that one, the plain bow. Then you've got spotty bow. Then you've got a different color bow as well. Yeah. There's like tons of like the classic mini ones with different versions now. Oh, look at these Halloween ones. Oh, yeah. I like them. I really like those. And they've got the pumpkin ones, too. These are really, really cool, though. I like the These are Coco. Yeah, I love Coco so much. I was just saying to Cla, you can see how quiet it is walking through here. And it's about 10:00, I think, or something like that. It's not early in the morning. Um, so the people aren't here yet. This is just what it's like on party days. It's a lot quieter in the day. And that goes for Mickey's Not So Scary and Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party. On the party days during the day, it is very quiet. Love Tiki Room. Paul actually really enjoyed this last time, although we did think it was going to be real birds. The ticky ticky ticky ticky ticky room. Exactly. That the song will not leave you. It's a bit like Small World in that respect. If you hear the song, you will hear it all day. But it is a really cute show. If you haven't done it before or you're looking for something just to do in between, definitely do this. Time for our first return time. Pirates of the Caribbean. An absolute classic. This is one of my favorites in the Magic Kingdom. It's just the smell. The smell has a lot to do with it. It is such an Orlando Disney trip smell. What time is it? Are we definitely It's 10:39. Yeah, we are. So, we are in this bit, aren't we? Yep. We do have a return, but it's actually only a 5minute wait. This is kind of what it's like on these days. [Applause] Oh my goodness. What is going on? That was an actual pirate. Got regular version of the pirate stands going on there. Oh, here we go. Is that It's the jolty bit at the end always gets me. Uhoh. Claire just got a direct hit. [Music] Oh no. That really soaked me. Don't be chicken. That always makes me think of Catherine now. [Laughter] I'm studying the map. [Music] I'm confused about where Beacon Barrel is cuz it clearly is not where I thought. Oh, there the beacon barrel. We are just going to see where it is because we do have a reservation there later this trip. I can't wait to experience that and show you that in the vlogs. Oh, yeah. Here we go. Yes, it's here. So, we had that wrong. I thought it was over there, but it's actually here. We will be back another day to do that. Cannot wait. Not sure what they've got here at the moment. Golden Outpost. Let's have a look. Tiana's famous beignet. Yeah. And hot honey chicken with sweet potato fries. You know, both of those things would be nice. And the beignet, just so you guys know, are a snack credit on the dining plan because it's not too busy here at the Magic Kingdom today. I might just see if we can go into the DVC lounge. I just want to get a drink cuz I need to take some paracet because I still have a headache from travel day yesterday. I do absolutely love it in here. It's just so relaxing. It's airond conditioned. You've got coffee and tea and drinks and stuff. It's really nice. CLA's never been in here before. No, I love it. It's Well, it's like Back to the Future 3 when they're in the bar. Cla's just investigating this interactive screen because when it's left for ages, it just looks like a really cute farmhouse shelf, but it's a screen and then I guess you can click it and it shows you different DVC resorts around the world. There you go. You can see it now. I really think that's cool. I love that. Just heading over to Haunted Mansion now and we've got lots of walls up where the Liberty Bell is now gone. This is going to be becoming the new Cars Land Piston Peak and it's going to take a while. I'm not sure when it's going to be opening, but we're talking, you know, a couple of years for that. Looks like the wait time is 30 minutes, but we've got our return time, which is good. I think we paid $23 each for this today. I love that little sound it makes. Oh, I've never seen that giant fan before. That is huge. That is the biggest fan I've ever seen. Well, I was in the middle of just saying how big a fan I am of the Haunted Mansion, but that is even more of a big fan. Is this haunted room actually stretching or is it your imagination? And are the monsters of the greatest ghost fighters of the literary world? [Music] [Music] [Music] Make final angels now. Leave them undying. ahead of you. Hey, Mr. Toad. Oh, I can feel rain. All done on the mansion and we ran into Jack and Cheryl there. So, it was really nice to talk to you guys. So, thanks for saying hi. And now we're heading down to ride Tiana's Bio Adventure. I love Tiana's. It's so pretty. I love what they've done with it. Yeah. Well, cuz last time, actually, last year when we came, I hadn't actually watched Princess and the Frog. No, you hadn't. So, I have now watched it. So, so yeah, it will kind of mean a little bit more to me this time. Yeah, I absolutely love it. And I although the drop is obviously the main event, I actually love the inside. I know. I just love going around and looking at all of it cuz it's they've done it so pretty. It's so good. Yeah. I actually enjoy the majority of it more than the drop, even though the drop is fun. I do have a poncho though because we are going to Target and to Olive Garden for dinner and I don't want to be soaked. So, I am gonna put my poncho on. We're not sure if we're supposed to walk down here, but it's not closed. It would be blocked off though, wouldn't it? If you couldn't. Let's just see what is going on here now. Oh, this makes me sad. I'm sad instantly. The Liberty Bell has gone. I'm so sad that we didn't get to do this cuz Paul actually really wanted to do it and we ran out of time. Yeah, I never got to do it. It's so good. This is actually a really nice angle to look at Tiana's as we walk. We can see how wet the people have got as well. That guy at the front is very damp. Yes. So, yeah, she is as well. You can see on her t-shirt. I like going at the back cuz I feel like the drop feels better when you're at the back. Okay. All right. Well, I'm all up for that. So, we do have our return time for this one. But just to show you guys, the standby is 15 minutes. That's crazy. It is crazy. So, in September, today is September the 9th. So, this is the kind of wait time you can expect during the day, which is so amazing. It is. Yeah. Yeah. We we did this to be on the safe side cuz we knew we didn't want to do a long day here. But it means that we could potentially like do it again if we were coming here on another party day without having to then look. Yeah. So, it's really really good. We are the longest musicians for our party. Now all musicians out here would love for y'all to play at my party tonight. [Music] What are you saying? There we go. Love it. That was not too bad. Actually, I do I always get it in my eye, but I can feel the moisture on my face, but I'm not drenched. No, no. I can see you're a bit like splashed, but that was not too bad. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you can see it like on my t-shirt. And I love this end bit. There's still more to come. [Music] [Music] We're just going to nip into Critter Co-op. What did you think of uh Sky Adventure? It's so good. It is genuinely one of my favorite rides I think in the whole of Disney. Like I love it that it's got the little drops cuz I always forget that they're coming. Especially the one that does a double thing. Make me make me scream. And then I love that it is a thrill ride and has got the big drop, but it's just so pretty to look at. Um and I Yeah, I just love the singing. I I love the bit where you then see the fireflies and then you come around in the end cuz it's the most colorful bit. I love that bit at the end. That is my absolute favorite. I love it. It is one of my favorites. Definitely. I'd go on it. I'd go on it every day. I came to Magic Kingdom. Oh, there is some kind of big giant box in here though. Sealed off. Obviously doing some work there. But this is what I love in this store. Look up at the ceiling and it's like tree roots up there. You've got the little fireflies. We just looked at these in the um little shop that's at the end of the attraction and these light up. I've never seen those ones before. They got Tiana's Bio Adventure Loungefly. That's actually really pretty as well. I would say that because I love turquoise. I love this like teal kind of color. And you can buy the little fireflies in a jar, which is so neat. Look at that. Oh my gosh. It's a Louis. Yeah. And it has Oh, that's so cool. I love that Joyful Celebration Spirit Jersey. I just love Louis. I picked up the Louiswis cuddle pillow last time I was here and absolutely love it. You can see the hoodie here on the model. It's actually got the little like scales, I guess you call those, on the back. Look at this guy. [Music] maker. [Music] So, just heading into fill her magic. Now, last year I didn't get to go on it because we tried to come here when it was Mickey's not so scary Halloween party, but it was closed cuz they were using it for a trick or treat place. So, I was really sad that I didn't get to do it. So, I really want to do it this time. They were showing the Adventures of Victor and Mr. Toad, though, if I remember correct. Yeah, they were. They were, but I wanted Phil Magic, but Philhar Magic is amazing. And the Coco scene, I know I go on about it, but I just think it's amazing. [Music] I love this music, too. Filh how Magic is a very relaxing place to be. So, Cla's gone to ride Space Mountain. I never do that one. It shakes me around way too much. So, I'm going to nip in here to Pinocchio Village House. I feel like I need a little something to eat. We're eating tonight at Olive Garden. So, I definitely don't want to eat too much, but I'll get some kind of snack. And then after that, Cla's going to come back here. We're going to go to ride a Little Mermaid, then get the train around from the Storybook Circus area to Main Street, and then probably go in a few of the stores and stuff before we head out of here for the day. So, that's the plan of action. And I always do mobile order. I just find that much easier. It's not filming the screen very well, so apologies for that. was doing a weird lighting thing. They've got a buffalo chicken flatbread, which is a featured item, chicken parmesan sandwich, all meat flatbread, pepperoni flatbread, gourmet cheese flatbread, Caesar salad with chicken. Oh. Oh, the little clock's going off. I'm probably going to have chicken strips with Caesar salad, I think. Right, got myself something. And in the end, I went for the side salad. So, this is just a really nice little small size salad. And then I got the kids um chicken strips. You just get two. And for the side with the kids meal, I just got two mandarins cuz then I can eat those later on. Comes with a little water as well. And I paid $12 something for that. So actually that's not too bad at all. And I really just love the Caesar salad here with the chicken strips on. And they used to sell that as an actual meal, but they don't anymore. But this is quite nice because once you put your chicken strips on top of the side salad, it's not too big. So, that's a really nice little compact size. It's been so nice so far today. It's been a really relaxed day. And like I said with the um multipass, we really didn't need to do that today in hindsight. And I suspected that would be the case just because it is quiet on party days. But like Claire was saying a minute ago, she's still glad that we did it because it's just meant that coming into today, we didn't have to worry about are there going to be long lines or are we going to be able to do all the attractions we wanted to. We have just been able to make extra lighting lanes as we've gone along. So Claire is obviously just doing Space Mountain now and that was a Lightning Lane and we've been able to make extra ones easily today. It has been so quiet. I haven't seen the Magic Kingdom as quiet for a while. Last time I was here was in May and obviously when I was here with Paul, it was a lot busier than this. So September is definitely a good time to come in terms of crowds. It is still quite humid, but it's definitely not as hot as it was in May. And also you do get a lot of thunderstorms and showers and stuff at this time of year, but that is just Florida for you. That happens all the time. I think for me my favorite it probably is still May even though it can be quite hot because I do love Flower and Garden Festival but January, February is starting to become one of my favorite times of year just because I love how much cooler it is and I love Festival of the Arts and Epcot as well. So it really depends. Different times of year are good for different reasons. I do get that question a lot. I love the outside of this attraction. It looks so good and actually those storm clouds brewing that does give it like can almost be like what happens in the film. Yeah. Yeah. about having an Ursula moment. This is my favorite castle out of all of them. Yeah, this looks so good. It's been great today just walking onto these rides. Go you make you not a fish. [Music] Love that. Such a cute ride. And we're just going to walk through here to get to the train, which I'm hoping is still running, but I don't have reason to believe it's not. Oh, I hope it is. Yeah, I know. That'd be disappointing. Going to take a quick look in Big Top Souvenirs. I sometimes find some quite unique stuff in here. Oh, yeah. Smell that. I wish you guys could smell through the vlog. Yeah. Love how this place looks. They've got lots of Halloween items. These like puffy ears. These are actually really soft and puffy. This Halloween shirt is very cool. If Paul was here for the Halloween party, he would totally wear that. And they've got the lug bag here. That's so lovely. I mean, it's it's small. Yeah, it would be too small for me. That's the problem with these ones. I'm not a Croc fan, but if you do like Crocs, I think you would like those. And the mug. Oh, Claire's just popped up. That's really nice. That's so funny. You just like near cated up over the top of the thing. They do have some really nice treats in here, though. Did you say that Catherine quite likes the apples? Catherine is obsessed with the apples. She does love Easter. But which one does she normally go for? Whenever we've been here, it's been the Easter ones. So, she quite likes the Easter cuz I mean I think that one looks obviously the most classic. It's worth noting that the tables and chairs are back in here again. And there's a few more over there. For a while, they taken them away. And these are actually really handy for sitting down and eating your snack. So, I'm glad those are back. [Music] This train's headed straight from Main Street, USA. We'll head on back to Fantasy Land after that. Stay seated and keep your hands and arms, feet, and legs inside. [Applause] [Music] would say we give our fellow travelers a friendly way to open after all. Welcome to Main Street, USA. You can see the top of the castle. Yeah, this is actually a really nice view from up here. Yeah, you see the castle poking out. Cla just uh pointed out there. Except it would be lovely if the sky was blue. Yeah, it's a bit I can feel some drops of rain. Actually, we could just see as the train was pulling in all of the people waiting to come in for the Halloween party. They should be able to get in in about 20 minutes time. So, I think we're going to go down onto Main Street, take a look in a few of the stores and then come in, maybe go after that. Yeah. So, I think that's what we're going to do. I love this picture of Lillian. I've never noticed that before. Lillian is Walt's wife, just in case anybody didn't know that. It's a very pretty picture of her. That's nice, isn't it? And there's the man himself. I love that there's a picture of both of them here. Yeah. I love Main Street so much. I know. Even when there is drops of rain. Yep. It still is great. It's always beautiful whatever the weather. See what's new in the ear section. Love the Cruella ones. They're really fluffy. I think this bag is new. They had one of these for the 50th anniversary that was in a navy color. Now they've got it in this red one. They are larger than a Loungefly. Oh yeah, they are quite a lot larger. Yeah, you get more in there. Yeah. Like if I put mine next to it. Yeah. So you definitely get more in that one. It's like a little suitcase. Yeah. I do quite like the square shape. This sweatshirt is really nice. I love that. I've seen these a lot on Instagram in the last couple of weeks. They have the Starbucks almost like a Stanley Cup style, but I don't think it is a Stanley Cup, is it? It's just Starbucks brand. Sometimes these ones are like Turvis, but I don't think so. I think it's just Starbucks own. It's a really nice design though. I love that. Yeah, you've got like a Mickey pumpkin on one side. Yeah. And then I think it was um like it's different colored ones. That's really nice. Look, your little normal Starbucks cup. That's cute. I love that. I feel like you should have that. Yeah. Look at this Haunted Mansion range. Oh, Victoria, you need this. They've got a spirit jersey as well. It says ghost host. Yeah, look at it. So good. Crocs as well. The Crocs are everywhere. And they've got mugs here, too. They've got this Haunted Mansion range as well, which is like the wallpaper. I think I prefer the green one. Yeah, I do. I really like this shirt, though. Yeah, that is nice. That's actually very cool. Cla's spotted some Winnie the Pooh stuff. Oh my gosh, look at his hat. Look at how cute that is. Eeyore with the candy corn hat. A, that really is very, very cute. Look at Pig. in his dinosaur costume and Tigger jumping out of the pocket. Oh, look. And he's in a pumpkin outfit who is like scared of his shadow. [Music] That's really cool though. I love that. Just over here is all the Halloween party stuff. So, it's roped off. We will of course look at that when we come back from Halloween party, but we can't go in there today. I'm trying to get a little sneak peek at what they have. It's hard to see though. So, we'll come back and do that on Halloween party night. Look at the Mickey vampire bag. I mean, to be fair, they're all nice, really, aren't they? But yeah, that's quite cool. This mug has got, if you look at the side, you got the cheetah there, the sassy cheetah from Small World. Got Space Mountain. I can see a doll whip and popcorn. Yeah. Fireworks, Tron, Orange Bird, Dumbo, Montreal, and that's a Starbucks one. That's actually very cute. I love that. We decided to exit from there because people were coming in for the merchandise. It really was getting quite busy. We're just going to head over to Main Street Confectionary to see if there's a Disney treat that we want to take back with us. I'm sure they will. I'm not going to get popcorn, though. I normally do, but I don't know. I feel like that's a big snack. I feel like I need a massive snack. I feel like I need a little snack. The last time I got that, I didn't end up eating all of it because there just is so much and then it goes stale, which is not good. Oh, the smell. Straight in. And we've got some Halloween apples here and the Rice Krispie treats. This is the best place to look if you want to see everything that they have. This is all the different treats in here. I think these ones here have been done for the Starllight parade and the popcorn as well. I don't know what I want. No, neither do I. Claire has got the Twi Is this the Twix? Yeah. Well, it's called the Blondie Pie, but it is Twix. Nice. That looks amazing. I can't decide. I do love a Rice Krispie treat and I quite like the like Starlight grade one. This one down here. Yeah, I think this one. Yeah. Yeah, that looks nice. I did just ask about the trash can. Someone asked me to get one and they have sold out. Oh no. I was potentially going to get one for myself, but yeah, the trash can or trash candy where you put your candy inside are no more. They have sold out and they don't know if they're ever going to get them again. So Oh my goodness. Really? Yes. I should have got one at the time. Never mind. We live and learn. It's time to say goodbye to the Magic Kingdom just for now. The vlog isn't over. I am going to put Target up as a separate vlog. But we will be back with you when we get back to the resort and do a round up of the day and everything, but there's going to be plenty more from the Magic Kingdom this trip. We're back to the Halloween party and I think another day as well. We're coming back one evening to do the parade. Um the new Starlight Parade, which I'm so excited. Yeah, me too. It's really cool. There's going to be much much more Magic Kingdom to come. But yes, goodbye for now. Everyone's coming in for the party. So, we're going to make It's getting busy. Yeah. So, we're going to leave now. And our plan of action is to go to Animal Kingdom Lodge to get our Uber across the Target because that's the closest to the Target that we're going to. And we've decided to go in because we might actually eat here, we think, rather than go somewhere different. We were going to go to Olive Garden tonight, but we might do that tomorrow night. And we're going to check out Victoria Falls first of all, cuz I did see something the other day saying that they have some small plates that are quite nice. Otherwise, we'll go to the Mara. So, we'll see. But Cla just really wants to see us. I can't wait to walk into the lobby. Here it is. Oh my gosh. Doesn't matter how many times I see this, it's just stunning. It is beautiful. It is, isn't it? Look at I love the lights. Like the big lamp shades. Yeah. And like I said, no matter how many times you see it, it just is incredible every single time. And this whole area down here, there's so many nice places to just sit and relax. I'm just sitting here relaxing, and it is honestly the best place to sit and chill. I cannot recommend this highly enough. In fact, I might set you guys down next to me and you can just chill here for a while with me. [Music] [Music] Just here in the shop now. And look at these ears. These are so nice. Even the shop at this resort is so beautiful. [Music] I love this little Carl and Ellie mail box. And actually once you've eaten the I think it's got chocolate or biscuits, animal crackers in there. And then you can use it as a money box once you're done with it. And look at the other side with the little flag. That's really cute. And this is Victoria Falls. I think we just go down these stairs. You got Bulma right down at the bottom. And we're just going to go on this level. It does look kind of busy, but hopefully there'll be a seat and we can just see what they've got. I don't know that we will want to eat here cuz they only do a few little small things, but we'll see what they have. Olives with almonds, spiced goat cheese dip with breads. Cape Town slap chips, which is fried potatoes, a regular apricot sh. Oh, I would try them. They sound really interesting. Suya spiced duck drums. M fry burger and seasoned chips and a grub board which is like meats and cheeses. Our drinks have arrived and we both ended up going for one of the drinks that's on the alcoholic menu but no alcohol in it. So you can get it as a mocktail because frankly we're too tired to drink alcohol. We're not it's it's not that moment. I don't drink a lot anyway. Cla's not a big drinker either. I've got this one which was the pear like mule. And mine is a bit more like a pina colada. Kind of like a pina colada, but it says something about chai. Yeah, spiced chai colada maybe. Does it taste in Have you got like chai vibes going on? Oh, no. Okay. Pineapple is the overriding flavor. But it's very nice though. Lovely. And we are getting the Cape Town slap chips as well. So, I'm excited for those to arrive. I'm wondering if it's going to be anything like a night blossom cuz it's got that pink hair kind of look to it. It's probably going to be nothing like that. I really like that. It actually has got night blossom that edge to it because it's got that pear flavor. Oh, my exciting happening over there. And it has like a ginger like a really almost like fizzy slightly spicy gingerness to it. Really really good. I might get Claire to try it. I don't know if you can hear me at this point. Oh, really good. That is nice. Yeah, I absolutely love that. I mean, that is nice and sweet, and I do always go for sweet drinks. So, yeah. I mean, I'd have both of them again. Yeah. The slap chips have arrived. And these look good, don't they? I don't know if you can see, but that one in particular, it looks like quite nice and crispy on the outside, but then really soft and fluffy on the inside. Yeah. And I feel like they look quite salty. Yeah. Cuz there was a craze for this type of thing. I kept seeing them on Instagram like the the the smashed potato craze with various different flavors on M. Is it good? Yeah, that is quite good. What is it? Is this rocket? I think so. Yeah. Are they spicy? No. No. It has got a nice crunch to the skin. Yeah. Oh, nice. Okay. This is what it looks like. They do smell really good. They're quite tasty, aren't they? They're really nice. Yeah. Okay, I'm just going to put this out there. If you are ever wanting to go somewhere and chill, wanting to take a break, come to Animal Kingdom Lodge and get yourself one of these drinks, some of these um smash chips. What are they called? Slap Slap Chips. Get yourself some slap chips. So, that's going to be it from Animal Kingdom Lodge. I don't think we'll be back this trip. We don't have a reason to come back. That doesn't mean we won't be. Oh, here. Yeah, but we don't have any plans to. So, just wanted to show you this amazing lobby one more time. We are back at the room now. It was really hot and sweaty walking back to the room. So, excuse me looking a mess. I've got my cup of tea in my refillable mug and we have just been back here chilling now. I'm really glad we went to Animal Kingdom Lodge and went to Victoria Falls. That was so good. The drinks there and what we had to eat was really good. And I just love going to the resorts and discovering the little lounges, bars, and places where you can get coffee and stuff. There's so many nice ones in the Disney resorts and they're just such a amazing site, the hotel lobbies. So, if you haven't ever done that and gone around to the different ones, I would highly recommend doing it. I normally take one day off my trip, usually a Saturday. That was Cla coming in. Um, usually a Saturday to go around the resorts because the parks are busy. So, that's a good day to do that. And I just love it. There's so many different ones, so many different things to see. So, I definitely try and take some time to do that because it's just one of my favorite things to do. Today was amazing. We really enjoyed it and it was just good to have the multipass. Like I said, I don't really think we needed it. I definitely couldn't say that it was necessary in any way, but we did like the fact that we had that arranged ahead of time. We knew we'd definitely be able to ride Tiana's Bayou Adventure and not have to queue for a long time for it. So, we were just glad that we did that. Just feel like we did loads of stuff really. I mean, we were obviously up nice and early. What did I do today that I hadn't done? I went on the train. Yep. Cuz we hadn't I hadn't done that before. Did you do Space Mountain last time? Oh, you did? No, I didn't do Space Mountain last time. It was down and then that Cuz you said Phoebe would have wanted you to do it. Yeah, that's right. So So yeah, I'm I did do Space Mountain. I mean, I had done that before, but I didn't do it on the last one. So yeah, I did do it this time. What else was The lounge was new to you as well. Oh, yeah. I really liked the lounge. That was cool in there. That was nice to go in and have a drink and sit down. It was just a real nice calm, chill atmosphere. Yeah. And then, oh, I was really pleased that we did um feel her magic because we didn't get to do that last time and I do like that one a lot. And then going to Animal Kingdom Lodge. A food that we had there was lovely. Yeah, it was so nice to see Kate today. I did put something up on Instagram. I didn't put that in the vlog because we very briefly saw her and we didn't even plan it. We just happened to run into her. We knew she was obviously going to be there. um today, but we hadn't actually planned to meet today because we are meeting her tomorrow. It's her birthday tomorrow and we're going to go for breakfast. So, I will get her to briefly say hello in the vlogs cuz I know you guys would love to see Kate. Um albe it briefly because they've got other plans for the rest of the day, but we are meeting for a breakfast at Ae and Compass. And that's why we wanted to come back and get to sleep this evening because we've had two nights really of bad sleep. So, I didn't sleep good in the Premier Inn cuz I never do. Then, we had a really long travel day. didn't sleep very good last night. So, if I then don't sleep good again tonight, it's going to be off on a bad bad trajectory trae trajectory trajectory. Yes, this is how tired I am. I can't say words like that at this point in the evening. Um, but yeah, for the rest of the trip, if you do like get too tired at the beginning, it's bad news. So, we are going to head to bed on that note. Um, but I just want to say a huge thank you to everybody who came up to us today in the parks. We met so many lovely, lovely people today. Um, you guys are amazing who watch the vlogs and I love saying hi to you. So, please do always come up and say hello if you do see us. You need to be scared. Yeah, some people message me and say, \"Oh, we didn't want we didn't want to disturb you or we were worried about coming up.\" Please, please do come and say hello cuz we love it. And we're very excited for Epcot tomorrow. We are, like I say, going to breakfast at Airlen Compass. We then will be Guardians doing Guardians. Cla is obviously very excited. So am I. Um, I just want Disco Inferno again. I always do. So, we're doing that. We also have GO82, the Spaceship Earth Lounge. So, that is super exciting. I've never done that before. And we're going to try and ride Ratatouille because we keep missing out on that. Yeah. And I don't at some point I would really like to go on Frozen. Yes, we might try and do that as well tomorrow. We should also have a look at some of the food snacks around the world. Yeah, we definitely want to do that. Um, school bread is quite high on the agenda and CLA just saw on Disney food blog earlier today in the caramel store in Germany they have some kind of appleley crumbly thing pie. It looked good. It did look good. It did look good. So, we might have to try and make room for that as well. And I did show you earlier what Cla got from Main Street Confectionary. And I didn't show what I got which was the Rice Krispie treats and it's the one from like the Starite Colors. So, this I guess is to go along with the Starlight Pride. They had a few things that were this color. And am I going crazy? I mean, in many ways, but I'm asking for a specific reason. Did the stick used to be in the bottom of these? Oh, because I swear when you held it like this, it used to be up the other way. Oh, right. Am I going crazy? Oh, well, it Yeah, now you've said it, that seems weird. Yeah. I swear the stick used to be in the bottom almost like the neck and you would eat the ears first. So you'd eat it like the ears. Yeah. So they were all like this. So I there must be a reason. Maybe they kept falling off the other way. But I've never had one fall off the stick. But anyway, please let me know in the comments. Am I imagining it or did the stick used to be the other way up? Cuz this isn't a mistake. They were all like this. Yeah. So yeah, let me know cuz I don't know. But it smells good, looks good, and it's very, very pretty. So, I hope you guys have enjoyed this vlog. This will be travel day and Magic Kingdom, so I don't know how long it will have been, but I hope you did enjoy it. If you did, please do give it a thumbs up because that helps other people to find it. And don't forget to subscribe because there is so much coming up. We've got all of the rest of this trip.

      "transcript": "You may be wondering why we're getting up at 1:30 a.m. aka the butt crackadon. So, let me do a little explaining of why in the world we were up at 1:30. So, instead of picking the 5:00 p.m. flight that was available, we decided to pick the 500 a.m. flight, which meant our flight started boarding at 4:15 a.m. Yay us. And since it boarded at 4:15, that meant we need to be at the airport at 3:15. So, with us, we are lucky. Nashville has really great security and we have TSA pre-check. So, we are literally through in 5 10 minutes tops. Works really great, which is fantastic. And means we only need to get there 1 hour before our flight, which put us at a 2:15 a.m. needing to leave the house. Like literally bums and seats. We got to roll cuz we live an hour away from the airport. So, that's kind of our little time frame there. And then we're like, \"Okay, I think we can get ready in 45 minutes.\" We had literally everything laid out, everything that we could in the car. And it was nothing more than putting on clothes. The girls ended up sleeping in their travel day outfits cuz I mean, I feel like that's no different than sleeping in your pajamas and then flying in your pajamas. And that's how we got here. [Music] I may shock some people when I say this, but this is early. So, our strategy for an early flight like this was literally to be like, \"Okay, you can have a snack during takeoff. That way, we can be chewing, swallowing, minimizing, having any ear issues. For us, that works great for our kiddos.\" So, that's what we did during takeoff. And then, we are pulling out the blankets. I love my little travel blankets. Bella had hers. she used as a pillow and we actually shared mine cuz it is a really good size blanket. I will link it down below. Just suffice it to say it's amazing and I don't know why it took me so long to buy one. So, just don't take so long like I did. But when it comes to our strategy, this was it. Girl is chowing down on some Doritos. That was her snack of choice for the flight. And then we were like, \"No activities. We're going to have chill time on the airplane.\" And we just kind of forced the nap. no toys, no yodo box, none of that. And so we had them chilling and thankfully it turned out really well. Now with Dean and Lucy, they were sitting together as well. And he did pull out her yodo box. So I'm like, I thought we talked about this, but it worked out. She still ended up sleeping on the plane. She got to play with her yo-yo box for a few minutes and listen to a story, and that helped relax her. And then she also fell asleep. So, you know, whatever works. Just wanted to share that though is like if you can force it, try to force it. I have kids once they are up usually at home, they are up. They will not go back to sleep. That is not happening. But thankfully, this early in the morning, they were still exhausted. And even though they fell asleep for a little bit in the car, we were still able to thankfully fall asleep on the plane. So, hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. They napped, which was much needed because, you know, shockingly, this is early, guys. And I know you're probably wondering, well, why in the world did you book a 5:00 a.m. flight to begin with? So, when I was booking our flights to Orlando for this trip, we had three options. The first one was a free flight thanks to Spirit Points at 5:00 a.m. The second option was a free flight at 5:00 p.m., also thanks to Spirit Points that I could use, or any other time of day. So, like, you know, a normal timeish of day with Southwest, but it was going to be $110 per person, and that's each way. And so, I'm like, hm, thinking about this, I can either do a free flight and spend the entire day at Disney, I can do a free flight and potentially run into rain showers and things later in the afternoon. Being during hurricane season, the fall, that's a huge thing that you have to potentially run into. So, we didn't want to do that. So, ultimately, we went for the free flight at 5:00 a.m. Thank you, Spirit Points. She and I have successfully slept about 90% of the flight. I'll take it. And because this was, you know, early, we've kind of established that. Hopefully, no one's shocked at this point. But because it was early, we're doing one of my favorite things, and that is mobile ordering coffee while the plane is taxiing in and that way when we're getting off the plane and all that good stuff, we're walking in, we can go and grab our coffee. it's ready because I don't know, Starbucks can be a little slow sometimes. No shade, but it just can be. The one in this one can feel like it's waiting on Christmas. Actually, you know what? I think Christmas comes faster than your coffee does at this location. Don't ask me why. It's just a very popular location in the MCO airport. So, yeah, that's why we pre-order. And naturally, it's probably going to be a two coffee day for the day this long. So, we got uh Starbucks here at the airport. You just don't know everybody. If you're a resident, welcome home. Fun fact, if you are Flying Spirit and you're gate checking your stroller and they give you anything other than a green tag to go on it and it's not the correct tag. They gave us a pink one. And Dean's like, \"These are usually green. Did they change the color?\" And they're like, \"Yeah, this is this is a gate check tag. It'll be there at the end of the jet bridge just like when you gate check it here.\" It is not. It is actually at the carousel. Well, if you want your stroller there, just know that one for future reference. Big step. Big step. Finally. I got a bed. Hey, Bella. Bella, you're walking with the wrong family. Bye. Bye. [Music] So, we are all checked in here at the Polynesian Village Tower. I am so stinking excited to be here. We spent one night here in January and it was chilly to the point that we couldn't get in the pool. We couldn't enjoy a lot of the things that make the Polynesian the Polynesian. So, I'm so excited to be back. It's warm. The girls are already in the Moana splash pad. So, we are having the best time. We did check in. I did online check-in and then I also do check in here just to like make sure they know, hey, we're here. We're ready for a room. Especially on a day like today when we're here so early. It is literally 9:45. We've got here. We got checked in. We explored the lobby. We explored the back. We all changed into our swimsuits. We did the whole thing. And it was so kind. a family that was checking out actually gave Lucy a Mickey balloon. You get to go there. Was so kind. Like it was just the sweetest experience. Literally from the moment we've pulled up, today has just been the most magical day so far. Sometimes it goes great and then sometimes you have like these crazy days and today is just one of those days where everything so far has just been the most magical thing on earth literally. So we're very excited to be here. And also, while we're waiting on our room, I have to talk about the amazing agent that is hosting us, and that is Elizabeth with Two Sisters, Magical Travel. Seriously, if you are wanting someone who wants your vacation to go as beautifully as you do, can help with everything from making resort reservations, helping you pick the resort, dining reservations, all that fun stuff. Definitely check out Elizabeth. She is fantastic. I've worked with her multiple times over the years and absolutely love her. She is a sweetheart. Her and her sweet family come and visit Disney all the time. So, she also is someone she loves Disney and she's going to help you want to love Disney, too. And the beautiful thing about using a travel agent is it doesn't cost you any extra because Disney has already factored in the commission to give an agent with their bookings, whether you utilize a travel agent or not. So, that commission is just going nowhere basically if you look at yourself. And it's a great way to support other Disney fans. So, I will have all her information linked down below. So, if you want to check her out, you can follow her on socials and fill out her quote form, all that good stuff. But seriously, if you're ready to get a countdown going, like, I'm just We just got here and I already want to book another countdown to come back here because this resort is just so beautiful. I I love it. Oh, that's wet. Play that over here. Mommy, where is the chocolate? They didn't have any muffins. I thought they would have muffins, but they only had banana muffins. And I know you don't like banana muffin. Do you want to try to dip? I know sometimes you like syrup. Whoa. Plunge to the hills. Now, you don't dip until you're ready to eat it. That yummy. Hey. Hey. [Music] We've now moved over from the splash pad to the pool. So, I'm going to go swimming and enjoy myself. So, these clouds are starting to prove my point, and I'm starting to feel raindrops. Thankfully, the closest lightning strike is 21 miles away. So, I don't think they're going to close the pool, but just depends on how you feel about playing in the pool. And also, I can see the rain literally coming. And as an American, I also smell it. And just like that, it's raining. Don't get in there, Belle. Literally. No. Oh my goodness. Sure did. What do you want to order? Yeah. Yeah. And then lunch at Wulu has arrived. We've got the macaroni and cheese rebell. Lucy got the chicken. We're hiding from the rain. Dean got the infamous burger and I got the chowine salad. I'm excited. Oh, look at you. You got the handwriting everything. So fancy. So the the 5:00 a.m. flight and one or two basically for them 2 a.m. wake up call is definitely starting to kick. We're not like on the floor like melting down, but we are like slowly having more and more big feelings. So, it's 11:56 and I'm like crossing my fingers and toes and everything in hopes that we get our room soon cuz we could use a nap and I think that would re-energize us and help us with the rest of the day. But we're we're getting tired for sure. Right, princesses? Here are the sundaes for you. Oh my good. Just a minute there, Bella. Hi. You like it? Love it. You love it. You love it. No. Well, you're a like you love it. Sour. That's pineapple. I don't like pineapple. We ventured over to the gift shop cuz we have a little girl that we have promised that she could get a stitch to go with her angel plush. So, they need it need they need to be reunited. She needs a little friend. So, we're in the boutiquey seeing if we can find a Stitch. Surely since he's at the character breakfast upstairs, he's going to be in some one of the gift shops here. Oh, that's so cool that you found that. That's awesome. Okay, over here. Careful. Oh, that balloon is making me nervous. So, I got the mug. Dean got a sweater. Yes, a zip-up hoodie. But we're still on the hunt for Stitch. Yay. We're going to find it, though. Hi. Let's go. She's ready. All right. Let's see if we can find a stitch. We're on the hunt. my size of the All right, we have found Stitch. Love it. We found him. And then, can I use that gift card? I know. You're reuniting them. You're finally getting your stitch, huh? That's just the way his ears are made. Aloha. Aloha. How are we doing today? Pretty good. How are you? Good. Good. How can I help you? Um, let's do a cold brew. Like the flavor, like how many pumps you put in it? How do you guys make it? The same amount of pumps no matter what flavor you want. Okay. Can I get add a mocha and coconut to that? Mocha and coconut. You got it. Really pretty. Okay. It is an iced coffee with mocha and um coconut and I sipped a little and put like a two squirts of um half and half from the little station in the back. It is good. It's a little sweet, but it's not the sweetest thing I've ever had. What do you think for sweets? It's pretty sweet, but it's good. For me, I'd give it like a sweetness out of six out of 10. Yeah, like on a sweet level. Maybe like an eight out of 10 for you. Yeah, it's pretty sweet. It's good. It's sweet. It masks the bitter. All right, room is ready. We're going to go back to the splash pad. But we're going to go to the room first, drop some stuff, then go there. Let's go. All right, so don't get me wrong, the lava pool is incredible, but extremely crowded. We're heading back over to our pool. We also have friends that are staying here at the same time. So, we're going to meet up with them and do some more splash bed time. So, let's go do that cuz it's going to be a lot less crowded over there than it is at this main pool. Also, fun fact, as a poly guest, you can also go over and use that pool if you want to. It is open to Polynesian guests. So, whether you're staying in the tower, you're staying in the old DVC buildings here, or if you're just a regular Polynesian resort guest, you can also do that, which is cool. Yeah, we are higher than the Montreal. How cool is that? All right, hold it. Open far. Thank you. Squeeze. There we go. Whoa. It says, \"Happy birthday, Lucy.\" Lucy and Lucy. It's got your name on there three times. This is beautiful. We open the curtains. Is it this way? Nope. Oh, it's this way. Hold on. [Music] Wow. door. [Music] All right, we've got two tiny Moana and we are ready for the pool round two. That's also part of our game plan with today. It was insanely early. So, I am not putting any reservations. I'm not buying lightning lanes for a day like today. We are just playing it by ear and we'll you okay? We'll be able to just do what we do. Our main plan is to enjoy the resort. We may we do have annual passes. So, we may pop in and watch the parade and fireworks at Magic Kingdom. But again, we're just playing it by ear and we will see how we do. It's 2:00 and we seem like we're doing pretty good, but that could change quickly, so we'll see. [Music] No. [Music] It's a bit later. We are back out in about 6:38. So, we are headed to Magic Kingdom. We have napped. Hopefully energized enough because we can't sleep too long or else we'll ruin sleeping tonight in bedtime. But I'm hoping we've slept enough that we're in good moods. So, cross your fingers for me. We'll see how this goes. I feel like it's always such a learning curve. And even though we come a lot, I feel like every trip is so different and each phase is so different with your kids that it's like, okay, you may have found your rhythm this time and your rhythm may need to run at a completely different speed the next time. So, crossing our fingers [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Yep. Pizza for you. Yep. It's going to be hot. What's your wish? I hope I would have snow powers and make a great wish. And I love mommy. Even I love all the castle, even our hotel. And I love all of it. What did you all It's a small small world. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] We are going to attempt to go grab a spot for Starlight. It starts in less than 20 minutes, so we'll see. It's the first parade of the day on a holiday weekend. Our time here earlier in August was not terrible. So, I'm curious to see how it goes being a busier weekend. But, it really wasn't all that bad. I didn't think Heat. Heat. Heat [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] up here. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Applause] [Music] Most people are swimming this way. So, I feel like we're too big. We are headed back to the resort cuz we're like we've got an early morning. But those of you that are internet fan that also watch Spoonful will know this. I'm hanging out with KJ. Hi. We always do like cleaning and decorating videos. So, we got together in real life. And also, she has a Disney channel, too. Like, we never talk about that, but I will link her channel down below. Go check her out. Or if you need more Disney mom content, check out KJ. And obviously we'll be doing more decorate with me soon for sure. With some sort of Disney magic, we got three strollers, two doubles side by side and a single stroller in one single Montreal car like from door to door. I don't know how the doors closed, but they did and we did that. But I don't think we'll be able to do the same with the elevators here at Polly cuz they're tiny. So, it is 9:29. So, we're going to see if we can make it for fireworks from down below. The wave break terrace on level five didn't look super full of people. So, we'll see if it's actually full of people or not. They probably just started ready to begin. So, we're parking the stroller over there, and we're going to walk out here. Oh my gosh, there's like not very many people here. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Which one's next? I think it's Hercules. I'm a far off place where a hero's welcome will be waiting for me. The battles, the stories, the losses, and all the meories. Got to wait. There she comes. Look, there she is. Yay. Go, Tinko. Is that her? That is That's her flying through the sky. Is that her on the zipline? Yeah, that's her on the zipline. [Music] Well, good morning you guys and welcome to our last day here at Disney World. We're checking out of the Polynesian going to do Ohana breakfast. That was Lucy's birthday request. So, we are doing that is her one meal that she picked is like a fancy meal. We're doing that getting packed up the whole thing. So, let's jump back in time and get ready to leave, which is always the worst day of your Disney vacation. [Music] I'm not heading for the stars. Driving down the boulevard tonight. Playing on repeat. Watching people on the street as I go by. [Music] And it doesn't even matter to me where I go. I just feel I need to take a ride. Got my coffee cup to go and I'm going to hit the road tonight. [Music] Now my wheels in motion and my windows open with the wind blowing in my hair. I'm driving down the highway. Going to do this my way. I can feel it in the air. Here I go. [Music] Turning up the stereo in a place I didn't know till now in a different part of town. I see new colors as the sun goes down. [Music] No, it doesn't even matter to me where I go. All right, hit the window. [Music] Now my wheels in motion and my windows open with the wind blowing in my hair. I'm driving down the highway. Going to do this my way. I can feel it in the air. Here I go. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm not heading for the stars. Driving down this boulevard tonight. Yeah.

      "transcript": "Hey everyone, welcome to a new vlog from Target. You'll have to excuse my appearance. I've had a very sweaty day at Walt Disney World today and we've come here to Target to pick up some supplies, show you what kind of fall and Halloween decorations they've got. I love Target for seasonal decorations. It's a very beautiful evening here in Orlando. Now the rain has stopped. I know you guys love looking around as well. So, let's head in and see what they got. I'm immediately having to get used to US shopping carts because they don't corner and turn the same way that ours do and I always run into trouble. Oh, look at these. And they got some bronze pumpkins and gourds toad stools. How cute is this dog with his ghost outfit on? Why do I love that so much? It's currently the 10th of September, by the way. So, it's not quite Halloween yet, so we're not even in the right month. But Halloween starts early in Disney, also in Target. You get the stuff from pretty much in August, I think. Back in the UK, I have seen Christmas stuff in the stores already, which is a bit shocking. I'm definitely not ready for that yet. Got to get a look at the stationary. It's one of my favorite sections. Ah, like this bit. I love all the planners. Look at this um travel journal. That's nice. I always show this. I've actually had this book for years. I did get it here in Target so many years ago now. 3,000 questions about me. And you can just answer all of these. I feel like it's a really great thing to fill in maybe like if you were dating or even if you've been married for ages or together for ages. It would also be a great thing for you to pass down maybe for your children to read like your answer to all of these questions. I just think it's really cool. I love this. They always do have a lot of different journals and notebooks and stuff. Not that I need anything else like that. I have entirely too many as it is. You can sometimes get Eron Condrin planners in here. And I think there's a couple of other brands that I'm not as familiar with, but that do sell some of their planners in Target. Actually don't see any Araron Condrin ones here, though. Oh, I always need to smell the autumn candles as well. This one actually looks like a piece of pie. That's pretty cool. See what that smells like. Oh, it does not smell. That's surprising. I really thought that was going to smell. Then we have orchard cider. Oh, that is nice. That's so good. My luggage was at capacity, though, when we came over here, so I'm really not going to be able to take anything as heavy as a candle. It's a shame. I do like these kind of wicker woven pumpkins. They're neat. These giant acorn pillows are nice, too. They have some of the cuddly pillows. They have these at Disney, but I've never seen this exact one before. It is the same brand. It's like Minnie in her plaid dress. That's really cute. Mickey as well with his sleep hat on. Do you like to have a look at the seasonal mugs? They have this ghosty one. $5. And they got the pumpkin, black hat, and a witch. I love the frog with the hat on. I think that's my favorite. They have these snack pillows, cherry soda, a bagel, and some pizza. They are $25.49, though. I feel like that's kind of a pricey cushion. Halloween clothing. Now, those ones I would wear. Yeah, they're pretty cool. They are cute. Those ones I would not wear. Scary. He's so chunky. Oh, Catherine would love him. Very nice. A there's bingo as well. I got to take a picture of that for Catherine. They've got a whole Mario Kart World section here. I love that flower light. Three brightness settings. Okay, so you can have it dim or like real bright. I really like that. Yeah, look how big these cups are. Pick one up for scale. You'll see compared to Cla mug. That's huge. Quissant earbud case. That's so random. Like why is it a quissant? I do like it though. This is a good place to come if you're on vacation as well and you've forgotten any cables or you're finding that you're needing extra ones to like charge devices in the parks with your power bank and stuff. They have everything like that here. Popsockets are kind of pricey though, aren't they? Like $35. Oh wow. Yeah. They're very expensive. I don't know why they're so much. They're the same in the UK. They're just Is that one you've had before? Um I've had a very similar one to that. I feel like Lego have been really upping their game. They have some really interesting ones now. There's a Lego Mona Lisa, a Trevy Fountain from Rome in Italy, fountain garden, and there's a London one up here, and also New York. Some of these Lego sets are awesome. You can make a Lego vending machine. What the heck? And I love all these floral display Lego things you can get now. They have this entire set of like mini house plants. It's really weird. Like they just have so many now. The orchid is really cool. You can make a Lego Polaroid camera and a packet of film. I really like the wreath on the end as well. Oh yeah, that's nice. That's really nice. We're entering the Halloween area. Looking at the costumes is like the best part of coming to Target during Halloween season. It's just fascinating for me as a British person because the Halloween decor over here in the States is next level. We can get some stuff like this but just nowhere near on this scale. Oh, please tell me that Claire is putting this outfit on. She is. I love avocado. So do I. That is perfect for you. Amazing. Love it. You can also be a corn on the cob. You can be a pumpkin cat. What else should I be? You can be a burger. There you go. Love it. They have an actual grazing board costume. Yeah, that is quite cool. I've never seen a grazing plate costume. I think that might be my favorite. That's so random. Oh my gosh, I can't cope. Oh my gosh, there's more. This is just a very fun activity. I love though is that they're not scary. No, they're just fun costume. I would really love to be though is I think either a crayon cuz I'm pretty sure that's what Sue from the middle Yeah, she was. Obviously, you can get Halloween costumes in the UK, but they're just not as great as this. Or you can be a traffic cone. What is that? A coffee. I'm not sure what that is, actually. Should we know what that is? You can be a xylophone. Pickle ball set. Oh, a pickle ball set. I actually don't even really know anything about pickle ball, so that's why I didn't know that. You can also be a taco or a can of Diet Coke. [Laughter] Oh dear. I was going to pick up some milk, but I got some from our resort. I'm always fascinated by the coffee creamer because we just do not really have stuff like this in the UK. You can get coffee creamer, but probably just like one flavor, whereas here they have the Starbucks pumpkin spice latte, almond milk pumpkin spice latte. I think that's mint chocolate, peppermint mocka. Yeah, there's just so many. They have home alone frosted sugar cookie creamer. It's got Kevin on the front. I like to kind of compare prices to the UK. So, let's see what they have here. These small individual yogurts are $149 and these ones we do have in the UK something similar. $159. I think that's about the same by the time we've done the conversion from dollars into pounds. That does sound about right. A lot of groceries have gone up in the UK though from what they were. So, I do feel like the prices are falling a little bit more into line. Some things are still cheaper in the UK for sure, but a lot of our food prices are going up back home, so some things are probably not that different. You can get Antian's pretzel dogs. That is $9.99, though. That does seem like a lot. Frozen pizza does usually seem more expensive. So, these are like $629. And a 12pack of soda is $8.39 and then 3 for 18. Not sure how that compares. I don't really drink fizzy drinks back home either. Squirt. What was that? Grapefruit soda. I do like a Gatorade, so I might just pick up an individual one. They still have some Prime, but I feel like the hype has well and truly died down from when you couldn't get it anywhere. They only have a few there. Now, this is their plant-based section. And this is huge. They have so many things here. Korean barbecue riblets, sweet barbecue riblets, sausage, corn dogs, and all of this is meat-free, so crumbles, vegan mozzarella style sticks. Lots of plant-based chicken nuggets and chicken tenders there, and some fish down at the bottom. The M&M section is always an exciting place to be. I love the peanut butter ones, and they do have the peanut butter and jelly ones down there. There they are. Those were quite nice. Tried those on my last trip. I love York Peppermint Patties. They're so nice. Resist. Resist. I love the trail mix here in Target. So, I am probably going to get some. I thought they might have like more Halloween ones in a bigger packet, but they didn't. They just have so many flavors of nuts as well. Sweet fig cashews, glazed doughut almonds. I've had those before actually. They're really nice. Hot honey cashews, smooth ranch, dill pickle, pizza cashews. I am quite interested in those. I think we might have to try these. They have taco seasoned peanuts and chili lime. I'm going to get some everything cashews. Yeah, got to get these. Pringle mingle, dill, pickle, and ranch. I feel like Paul would really like those. Although I did get him some of the dill, pickle nuts, and he didn't like those. I was quite surprised, but he was not keen. Peanut butter filled pretzels. Ooh, they sound good. I've never had those. Look at the size of that. Yeah, that is massive, isn't it? Do love a funny. I feel like I might have to get some. I have had those ones at the bottom. These the steakhouse onion. They're like um bloom and onion flavor. They were a bit stronger. And they don't have the Sriracha Doritos. Paul was hoping they'd still have them, but they don't sadly. Pepto nausea. motion sickness. I bet these would be really good for anyone who suffers with motion sickness on the Disney rides. So, if you come to Target, um maybe try some of those for if you do feel sick on the rides, especially 3D ones and stuff. Got to take a look at the coffee section. I do love the Duncan coffee and I had a strawberry one. They've never had it again. It was a limited edition. They've got a cinnamon one. I feel like Paul would absolutely love that. Is it beans though or ground? I think it's ground. Maybe I'll get him this though because we do have a cafeteria. He could have some of that. Duncan apple cider donut, but that's good too. And pumpkin spice. In one of my vlogs over on my Victoria and Detail channel recently, we were discussing how expensive instant coffee has got back home. And this Maxwell House, which is nine servings, is $4.79. I feel like that's a really small thing of coffee, though. How much is just a jar of coffee? So $8.49 for that Nest Cafe. That is about the same as at home to be honest. Coffee seems to have gone up massively back home, but just the instant, not necessarily the coffee beans. And they do have loads of flavors of the coffee pods like then espresso pods and stuff. I would say more than we have back home. See how much basics are like pasta and sauce and stuff. So that jar of marinara sauce is $7.99 on sale. That seems like a lot though. Maybe that's an expensive brand. I don't really know. Bully I've heard of. H Okay, so the Bali one is $2.99. So I'm guessing that one we just looked at is more of an expensive brand. So $2.99. That seems reasonable. Got Reggu $2.39. Jar of Alfredo is $1.99. And these are their boxes of pasta. 99 cents for this one. $119 for these pasta shells. So things like that seem to be the same as in the UK. That doesn't seem really expensive. The fruit and vegetables do tend to be more expensive. Let's see what the latest is. $559 for these tomatoes. That does seem a lot, but it is a big packet of them. And then when you convert it back to But that still does seem kind of pricey. These potatoes $7.89. Is that right? That seems a lot for potatoes. Sweet onions $2.79. But there are quite a few in there. An individual pepper back home is kind of 60 70p I would say. And these are $159. So a little bit more. The cucumbers always look so different to ours. They always have kind of what I think of as little spikes. They're not actually spiky, but can you see what I mean? A cucumber is 79 cent. So that's the same as at home. Looking at a lot of this, I don't think things generally are wildly more expensive. And maybe it is just because in the UK things are getting more pricey. So, in the last few years, I always would have said it was way more expensive here for groceries. With a lot of things, it varies. So, on the whole, it probably still is more expensive, but I do feel like we're catching up a little bit. I just want a quick look at the lipstick because they have a shade of the L'Oreal matte liquid lipstick that you can't get in the UK, and I love it. This is the one that I have, and you guys comment regularly on this particular one that I have, but I don't see it. It was called summer fling and they no longer have one called summer fling. It really looked like this which has been smeared everywhere. Lovely. Ew. Who does that? And that's the only one they've got. That's a shame, but never mind. I look so braggled. Honestly, it's been so hot and sweaty in the parks today. Oh my goodness. What do I look like? Right, we're going to go and check out now and I will end this vlog probably when we get back and I'll show you what I bought. I really didn't buy much to be honest, but I will show you what we got. Oh, you've just reminded me of one other thing I need actually. Ah, I see it. It's over there. Black as black eye booster waterproof. Love this stuff. It's amazing. This is the liquid eyeliner I always use. We're back now. I've managed to give my hair a bit of a brush. Thank goodness. I was looking like Wel Gumage. Honestly, thought I would just do a very quick haul. This is super quick cuz I really didn't buy much. I got the Armond Hammer Peroxicare toothpaste. This is my favorite one. I use all the time. So, every time I come to the States, I get more of this. I got another of the Olay Sheia Butter, the small one. I use this whenever I travel um or weekends away and stuff, and I just love the fragrance of this one. Then, I got the pizza cashews cuz I've never tried those before and they sound fascinating. I got the everything cashews. Definitely have tried these and they are indeed everything. I got a pack of twisted fruit ropes, the strawberry, mango, just fruit snack things. I really love those. I got this Duncan Cinnamomania coffee for Paul and this is basically cinnamon bun flavored and a familyized bag of funans because funnians are amazing. So that's going to be it for this quick Target vlog. I hope you enjoyed having a little wander around Target with us. I always have to have a Target mooch. It was really fun actually seeing Cla trying on Halloween costumes this time as well. If you did enjoy it, please do give it a thumbs up.

      "transcript": "Hello you guys and welcome to our day at Disney's Riviera Resort. We are here spending the full day. We're checking in, checking out tomorrow. So, we're doing all kinds of things, helping you to know some tips and tricks for if you are already staying here and also to kind of give you some ideas of what it's like staying here. That way you can know whether you actually want to book it or not. And I'm so excited cuz we're also trying Toelinos for dinner for the very first time tonight. I will say though, dinner up until this moment has been quite stressful. So, I am so excited. My stomach's so excited. If you're excited too, go ahead, click that thumbs up button and let's go have some fun. So, we're kicking off our stay with some time at the pool. It is locked. So, you do have to have your Magic Band to get in and out. So, you cannot come over from Caribbean Beach and get in the pool. That is not allowed. It is for resort guest only. But this is the quiet pool. So, we call this the quiet pool cuz it doesn't have the slide. It doesn't have all of the activities going on. And it's also not right adjacent to the splash pad, so it's a little quieter. And it's also it's just usually a basic pool. But we are excited. We're gonna get some sunscreen on, grab some lunch, and I'm going to go pick up our mobile order from Primo Piato. Mobile order has been acquired. Now, time to hand it all out. Dig in the roll. I'm the noodle master. M farm fries. Naturally, we had to get the chicken Sammy and the tomato soup. Added a side of farm fries to share. The girls have the noodle kids meals with the sauce on the side. It did. It come with a mobile order sticker. I got a kids meal of pasta as well to go with it. Lucy got the same thing. And we're sharing the chicken. Sammy, can I have my half, please? Give me the Sammy. [Music] Huh? [Music] We came, we swam, and now we're ready to go to the other pool. Our room is ready, but don't feel like there's any point in going up to the room until we're like ready to shower and change and get clothes and do the whole thing. So, we're going to go. We've done what we call the quiet pool. Now, we're going to go over to the main pool with the water slide and a splash pad right next door. So, we're going to do that. They also that's where the gelato cart is located. So we might get some gelato. Who knows? We are enjoying our very last day here. We're doing this as a cap to our trip. So it's like one last day at Disney, but also spending the whole time at the resort. So we've been going hard. We've been doing the parks. We've been filming. We've done all the things. And now we're ready to chill, right? Yep. Yep. You look yourself. I did. I had to go dive for the sinkies that somebody left in the pool. I didn't [Music] I will say this pool gets extremely busy compared to the blue sole pool. Obviously, it has the water slide. It is right next door to the splash pad and it is also the zero entry pool. So, it's got a lot more going on. You do have the pool activity. So, if you have kids, that is great. But, if you are wanting more of a relaxing, chill vibe and experience, then I would definitely suggest hanging out at the Blue Sole Pool. if you don't want to be like walking around for a while looking for pool chairs. It's not impossible, but if it's hot and a lot of people are at the pool, everybody's wanting to cool off at the same time. It does get a bit crazy and hard to find chairs. Um, so just wanted to give that little heads up. Also, I really enjoyed the water slide here. I thought I filmed myself going down it, but I just took a picture. So, enjoy the fact that Dean was able to film going down the water slide. All right, headed up to the room. Right, number eight, please. Eight. Nope, that's nine. Number eight. We are being run inside due to lightning in the area. It's 2:51 in the afternoon. So, we grabbed some Mickey ice creams as a treat. We're headed to the room. Dean's gone to grab a bag so he doesn't we don't get stuck in a downpour trying to do that. All right. Off the elevator, please. We're going to go see our room. I'm so excited. We've never stayed in a onebedroom, so I'm like really excited. You like the view? Sh. Inside voice, remember? I know. I know. I know you're so excited, but we got to use our inside voice. I can't see the whole view from up here. It's a good view, isn't it? All right, come on. All right. Um 8840. All right. The water stick. Come on in. All right. It looks like our own fire. Oh my gosh. Must be the other side. Yep. It's the other side. Your bedroom has a marine picture. Does it? Yes. Oh my goodness. On the picture. What? Oh my goodness. You guys, this is beautiful. Mickey, that's so cool. I love it. This is beautiful. Oh, that tub. Oh my goodness. It's a big tub. Can I see how big it is? Yeah. Go check it out. Our view. Oh, this is gorgeous. Gorgeous. Gorgeous. Gorgeous. Or maybe this one has many on it. We'll see who this one has. Maybe on this one. Peter Pan. Oh, it's the Peter Pan bed. Oh, no. I want to make him. [Music] We're so excited. This is why I'm like, close your eyes again. I want to go with my uncle. Wow. It has [Music] up here. [Music] Yeah, you can see both of the pools from up here, Dad. Yeah. See, you can see the quad pool. It's in front of you. Um, your lap pool. I can see the lighthouse. Okay. What? Where's the lighthouse? Oh, he just hop in the building. I want to eat there. I want to eat there. I want to eat there. It's a bit later. We have showered. Dean and the girls have went to the venty room to do some coloring because I just finished filming the room tour for this, which should be should be on the channel by the time you're seeing this video. So, if you want to see that one, definitely go over and check it out. I'm going to quickly do this laundry. So, hold one second. But, we came running in from the rain. They ended up shutting down the pool because of lightning in the area and it quickly moved in to the point where we grabbed some ice cream, came up to the room as you saw, and by the time we got up here, it was like just downpouring outside. Dean made it up thankfully right before the rain got here with the bag. So, we all jumped in showers and baths and did all the things. So, we are clean, refreshed, and ready for dinner. I am so excited for Topelino's dinner. Um, breakfast is good. like I don't think it deserves all the hype that it gets, but it it is good. So, I'm really excited to try dinner. I love the view from up there. It is an incredible view from that restaurant. So, we'll see how dinner goes. So, we're taking you guys along for that. It will be all in this video. It's not going to be a separate video, I don't think, right now. But it is 4:41, so almost 2 hours before dinner time or time for us to check in. But before I quickly run out the door, I did have to say a huge, huge thank you to Kayla from People Mover Travel, and she is actually the one hosting us on this trip. I will have all of her details linked down below. She's hosting our night here. She hosts us for quite a bit of our cabin stay, which I am so so grateful for. So, if you're looking for a genuinely amazing travel agent, I love being able to find amazing agents to work with and to share with you guys because truly, I have had a bad experience with an agent. And it literally haunted me for years that I just didn't want to use an agent. I didn't want to talk about agents. I didn't want to recommend people use travel agents because I just had had such a bad experience. And I'm like, Disney trips are expensive. I don't want to recommend you do something that's going to like end badly or end with you like showing up to reservations that this agent told you you had and then you don't have them and then you're upset and your kids crying and then it's like this horrible thing. So, I did not want anyone else to go through that whole mishap of just draw balls being dropped and things happening. So, I wanted to find great agents and thankfully I found some to work with and Kayla is absolutely one of those agents for me. I love it. She's actually booked travel for me outside of collaborating and hosting us. And so I can 100% vouch that she is 10 out of 10. Absolutely worth it. So be sure to check her out. Give her a follow. I'll have her socials linked down below. And when you're ready to start your own Disney countdown, definitely check her out. But I'm going to go meet up with Dean the girls. We're going to see what we can get into. I think the rain has moved on out. So maybe we can get outside a little bit, stroll around. We may want to stay inside cuz it is August and it's Florida so it's hot. But we'll see what we do. [Music] The Avente room I feel like is a hidden relaxing gem here at the Riviera. And anytime we've ever been in there, there's not been a ton of people which is really really nice. So, if you are looking for somewhere to relax, maybe get out of the rain like we were doing on this particular day, they have board games, card games, they had magnetiles in there for little kids to play with, coloring sheets, and if you are staying here, you can even do arts and crafts that you can pick up later on. They have amazing things in here. And the cast members were so, so sweet. So, absolutely loved coming in here. The girls and Dean played jingo for a bit. So, it was such a relaxing space. And also, if you're not staying here, you can still come in, play the games. Your kids can play. If you're doing a Skyliner crawl, this is a great place to kind of hang out if you're needing a break, needing an AC break, getting away from rain, like I mentioned. So, this one is such a cute hidden gem. So, if you're looking for places at Riviera, this one is on the first floor and it is near the Primo Piato. It's just around the corner from that. And seriously, such a cute space. Is awesome. They've got magnet tiles. Got all kinds of card games, board games, and even three big flat screen TVs. And they've all got elemental on them right now. It's pretty cool. [Music] [Music] One for D. Cinnamon cold brew. That's yummy. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] This is the softest thing and so Cute. Seriously, I love it. It's got the River Resort logo on the front. I like that it's basically plain on the back other than Disney Vacation Club member. So cute. Such cute merch right now. They got the Donald and Mickey shirt. Love the striped pullover. Got an ornament now for the Petite Cafe, which is cute. Got this ornament. Mickey and Minnie. Have this collection of postcards from the Riviera. Love this mug. $29.99 for the teapot. And then they also have this mug that looks like the towers. These are cute. Little salt and pepper shakers from Riviera. It's got some coasters and a little turvis action going on. Have a kids shirt coloring book with crayons. And then they do have some of the keychains of the characters in the Riviera outfits. Got Minnie Mouse and this pink tea. Got Mickey and Minnie in the plushies. Got the pullover. Then they also have this sweatshirt that says masterpiece with Mickey painting the Riviera itself. Got the athletic dress. Some beautiful pieces. I love the little purses. Those are cute. I like that they have a smaller one. The blue jacket still Riviera. Oh, that's super soft. Want to get one of the robes one day. Oh my goodness. Be amazing. And them suitcases are cute. Got some of the spa stuff. Riviera polo. Got the Riviera hat. kind of mesh back trucker style in the back a little bit. And this mug. Went ahead and grabbed this one. It's so pretty. $19.99. Says vacation club member on the back. Got the candle which smells amazing. $30 for that one. Then Riviera bottle. So so cute. They've got some really neat stuff right now. And then here in this center, just some Riviera specific merch. Got the t-shirt. We've got the vacation club member sweatshirt with the back that has the Riviera Resort on it. And then they also have this cute and it's so buttery soft, you guys. The Riviera Resort on the front. On the back it has vacation club member. I like how subtle it is. And they also have Vacation Club member joggers. They are comfy, but to me they look a little cheap. Like they feel nice, but as far as like the look of them, they look a little Scott Calvin. They're giving Scott Calvin. So if that's a good thing, I don't know. Ended up. I bought the sweater in here in the gift shop. It's so soft. Also, I was freezing. We were sitting in the aventi room and I'm like, I did not bring a sweater. I'm like the the pink and like the dark color kind of goes with the mauve dress. Like it felt like it was meant to be. So I'm like, okay, I'll get the sweater. Um, we did that and then we looked around. The DVC rep gave the girls a ton of stickers. We are loaded with stickers. Got them the coloring book. I love that Riviera has their own like special coloring book. It's got colors. It's got stickers in the back. So, that's really cute. We're just kind of killing time waiting for our dinnertime reservation. It's just after 6:00, so almost time that we can do check-in and head up. But I'm so excited for dinner. I'm really looking forward to it. And we tried two coffees. Dean got the cinnamon cold brew. You like the cinnamon cold brew, don't you? Or it's a mid one. It's not the best. It's not great. He was like, \"It's okay. I don't like cinnamon coffee, so it's just not quite my jam. I tried the frozen cold brew. While it is good, I still don't care for it a ton. So, I think in the morning when it's time for coffee, Dean's going to Skyliner down to Joffrey's and get the frozen toffee flight cuz that's like our favorite. It is like out of all the Joffre specialty drinks, it is the best and you can only get it there. It's so good. It's got like Twix on the top. really really good. Really good. If you've not tried it, you got to try it. That That is the coffee. I'm like I I want I want to love something from the Petite Cafe. I I've just not found it yet. Is this the library? Kind of. Should we be quiet or loud? You should be kind of quiet. Yeah. [Music] One zero right here. One zero. Oh, I can see our room, too. Come here, Belle. [Music] Wonderful. So I So it's um how many adults and how many children the age of nine? Uh two adults and two children under nine. Do you think that white ferris wheel is Disneyland? [Music] Okay. Shall we eat some dinner? Yeah. Yes. The characters here tomorrow morning. Yes. Here tomorrow. They're sleeping right now, but they'll be back tomorrow. They sleep in the morning. Yes. That's weird. They work in the morning, so they have to sleep at night. No, dinner. They're sleeping. I think they sit outside or inside. Inside right next to the window. So once we lift up the window shades, you'll be able to see the whole resort. Wonderful. Good. We did a quick little French fry appetizer for the girls. That is one of the secret things that's on the menu for kids is they do have French fries as a side. It's just not on the menu, which was what our waiter told us. Then you can also substitute the tomato sauce for butter, but they also have Alfredo, that sort of thing. So, their kids menu looks really good. Their adult menu looks also really good. The bread is fantastic. And I'm so excited. We ordered the famous ricotta appetizer. So, um I'm excited. I will say though, dinner up until this moment has been quite stressful. It's like my children have forgot how to behave at dinner. So, I'm itching, you guys. Yeah, we all have our moments and we're having a moment. The ricotta has arrived and it looks phenomenal. Fancy bread ricotta. I'm going to dip. Heck yes. We're family, right? I'm not mad about double dipping. Is it good? Nice. That's delicious. I'm so excited. It's my favorite, too. [Music] So, we got the girls their pasta. Got butter noodles for Lucy. Fries with the sauce on the side as her request. We got pasta. Got pasta for Bella. Macaroni and cheese. French fries with a sign of attitude. I got the chicken something rieton. cannot think of the middle word that went between chicken and rietoni, but it looks fantastic. I'm very excited about it. Your fillet looks really good. It does. It looks quite lovely. So, I'm excited to share. I I don't know what I was expecting, but this was not it. And it was definitely not on my bingo card to come in here and eat dinner and be this wowed. We're We're definitely going to recap this when we get back to the real because I've got some thoughts and they're very spicy. Nice. [Music] What is that? So silly. No. If you can time your dinner with either golden hour/ sunset or fireworks at Epcot, this is an amazing place to do that. I don't know which one is my favorite. You really, unless you're just a super slow eater, you can't really hit both, unfortunately. But it is absolutely incredible. Watching the sunset over the building and enjoying dinner. It was just absolutely perfect. The vibe was amazing. I would love to do this as like a date night is come back and have dinner here. It is amazing. The food was incredible. And we're going to recap that here in a second. But yeah, if you're making a reservation and you can time it between one of those two times, that would be my suggestion. [Music] Wanted to really quickly talk about the type of view you can book here. So all of the onebedrooms are exactly the same with the exception of the view type. So we had a preferred view and that was of the skyliner, the pool, that sort of thing. But then they also offer a standard view and that is of parking area. Well, beyond the parking area just so happens to be Epcot. So technically you get a fireworks view on a budget which is amazing. Now here's the catch. Those types of rooms do go really fast. That's why we were unfortunately only able to get a preferred view because I would have 1,000% preferred a standard view because you can request being there. Obviously, it is a request. It is not a guarantee. And not all standard views face Epcot. Some of them do just face the parking lot um kind of Caribbean Beach area. But if you get lucky and you get pixie dusted, then you can face that area. anytime I've ever put in a request for that. Thankfully, we've been lucky enough to get it. So, just wanted to share that little tidbit when you're picking what room. Okay, we got to talk about dinner. Oh, goodness. Yes, we do. Should we grab our cake while we dinner? You can grab the cake. I absolutely am 100% behind that. I support this. I support this idea. I'll be 100% in front of it. try to put my hair up in a bun because bath bomb they do have bath bombs in the gift shop. So, I got this one. It is the tropical aloha bath bomb. Was $9 before my AP discount of 20% for anyone who is curious. Um, it smells divine. And they had another one that was like a ginger smell. It was green. But I'm so excited about this. I was like, man, we've got I completely forgot about the fact that the one bedrooms have a tub until like last night. And I was like, dang it, I'm not going to be anywhere to get a bath bomb before we go cuz it's like my favorite thing about having this is like having a bath, doing a bath bomb cuz I don't we don't have that um at home. And I'm like this is a luxury. This smells like something you could eat. I know. It smells so good. Right. It's delicious. But we did bring the chocolate cake. We're like hiding in the bathroom. We just put the kids to bed. So, I mean, it's either here or the bed. I don't know. I'm not sure one's in the bathroom right now. That sounds about right. So, it's the warm chocolate cake. We ordered it to go cuz we're like, I'm tired of sitting here and like we can put the kids to bed and have it on the balcony and then enjoy our bath. So, that is the plan. But dinner, dinner, dinner. It's so good. It is good. Dinner was fantastic. So, I am in the minority that feels like Topelino's breakfast is overhyped. I'm not saying it's not good. I'm just saying it's not as good as everybody makes it out to me. Um, I don't feel like it's that much superior to any other character meal, but that's just me. Dinner is so underrated, it's not even funny. I don't know what I should have been expecting when we went here. I don't know, Edgar. It was fantastic. The the French fries alone, why were they so good? I don't know. And it's like sounds so stupid to say like the French fries, but seriously, like they did good. Um, also I don't know where I saw this, but someone I saw it in someone's Instagram stories. I wish I I knew so I could give them credit cuz I don't I don't remember who it was. Um, but ordering French fries as an appetizer Oh, yeah. was so helpful. Yep. So helpful. French fries, ketchup. Yeah. Appetizer. Perfect. Yep. Yep, that was the play. Um, but it was so good. My the pasta I got, the chicken, the pasta, the whole thing. It was so good. It was very, it was rich. It was creamy. It felt like a cozy meal. Like, it was so good. It was like, it the thing I can compare almost compare it to is like a beef stroganov. Kind of kind of. But it was so good. Like I I'm genuinely like I may want to book this in the future. So good. I have a tiny child poking their head in. Why are you not in bed? But it was amazing. I thought your fillet, the bites you gave me of that was fantastic. Yeah. Medium rare filet minion. Delightful. And then whatever sauce, I don't even know. I don't even know. It was fancy something. It was delicious. And the potatoes, I think the potatoes were like truffle something potatoes. Yes, they were truffle. So they had like fancy like pinkies out flavor of the potato. And the the the stuff the like brown sauce of some sort was I'm going to say it was better than gravy. It was so good. Like it was it it was all delicious. Like Oh, so good. I'm not a food critic, but it's one of those like that was really good. I would eat that again because most things that I see food critics say are good I don't like and I'm like I'm I'm very puzzled by why like why this is good I I feel like your Anton ego here. Um what the actual heck? Um no but it was very very good. So good. I would 100% I would do that again. Yeah, hands down. I I want to I want to go back. I want to eat another one. That was very underrated. And it was very easy to get a reservation cuz nobody's going there. It was empty. No, it was very empty. Um I originally had an 8:20 p.m. reservation for us. And earlier today, I'm like, I don't I just don't think that's going to go well. And I'm like, I'm going to trust that instinct that I know my family that we need to move this. And so I moved the 8:20 to 7:00 p.m. Good point. And that that worked out great, but it was so easy and there were so many times available today for dinner. So I I think it's underrated. It's not going to be hard to grab. I would say it's one of those you don't even have to wake up early to get it. Like you'll just probably be able to get it. Um, price-wise, it's it's pricey for Disney food cuz like my pasta was $40. I think the fillet was 60. Like is expense expensive. It was expensive. It's not something you would eat every day, but it's an experience, too, cuz it feels more like fine dining. It does. It feels fancier. Um, it's not as pricey as some of the like prefix menus, like comparing it to say like California Grill. Um, which may be like a complete stretch, but it's like it feels similar of like a fancyish like I would say this is a great date night place. Oh my goodness. If you were coming as a couple like that's I think it's perfect. Yeah. Light it up with fireworks. it like go out look at the view like the sunset coming in it is just gorgeous it's absolutely gorgeous so yeah that would be that's now on my list of like if anybody asked for any like romantic recommendations at sunset even Lucy was like oh look at this listen to the mommy is this romantic like what in the world yes actually yes this is romantic romantic it is if You two weren't acting all crazy, it'd be even worse, did they? Oh, yeah. They were they were full-fledged kids today. And it's not to say that they were just horrible cuz they weren't like screaming banshees and all this stuff, but it was just they would not sit still. They would not stop touching the blinds or the curtains. They would not stop touching the window. And they just like stick their fingers in the uh in the the ketchup. They're like, \"Don't stick your fingers in ketchup.\" It was just everything and then yeah, it was just it it was a lot. We balanced out. I just kept like we're going to get through this. Lots of deep breaths. Lots of deep breaths. We're going to get through this. Um thankfully we got through it. We leveled out pretty good. Um but yeah. Yeah. To topelos. Oh, that that was not on my bingo card that I would be coming out of that place being like this was so good. It was good. Worth it. I loved it. All right. Well, we're going to go enjoy our chocolate cake on the balcony. It's delicious. And then I'm going to have a date with this tub. Mhm. And my bath bomb. And we're going to relax and enjoy our bath bomb. That smells like it tastes delicious. This smells so good. Feel like you could eat it like a jawbreaker. My mouth is watering. That's ridiculous. It shouldn't smell that good. That's dangerous. That is dangerous. A couple of nights a chance. I'm not going to fool anyone. Just think about it. Luck. The abominable. They all have one thing in common, pal. They have an automatic [Music] [Music] [Music] Good morning you guys. It is her last day. We check out, we go home today. It's our last day at Disney. This was fun, though. I can definitely see wanting to do this again in the future. I don't know. Our trips can be so different each time. So, I don't know that we could do it every single trip. But if we were doing like a regular like six night, seven day trip, I I genuinely think I would make our like rest day, relax day, whatever this last day before we go home or like add a day of that at the end and like doing it at an incredible resort would be so fun cuz I for me I find it hard to justify spending a big chunk for like this entire trip cuz it's like we're not here a bunch like we are hardcore park people. Like if you're resort people then I obviously you can spend your money however you want to no matter what kind of person you are. But you know what I mean? Like I just feel like for me that just it's like wow that's a lot of money to spend to like just sleep there. So that just doesn't seem like a perfect fit for us and our family. But I absolutely love being able to enjoy it and do the resort day dinner at the resort. like having a nice restaurant at your resort, the fun pools. We got to do some pool hopping cuz obviously there's multiples here. Um had to have my chicken sandwich which was great. So I seriously love this. So if you're looking at a trip and you're like h I can't afford my budget just won't allow me to stay deluxe an entire time. Um maybe do a value or a moderate and then cap the trip with one night at a deluxe. And that's like you enjoy everything that deluxe has to offer, so you're kind of getting your money's worth basically. Um, yeah. And Riviera is a really great option if you're if you're interested. Um, I mean, any of the deluxe resorts would be incredible for a one last night kind of thing, but this this has been fun. I like this. It was a nice like windown after a busy trip. So yeah, I I can I can definitely say I'd recommend this. Here at Riviera, there's two forms of transportation. We got buses and we have the Skyliner. The Skylliner is super cool. Um Skylliner goes to Epcot and Hollywood Studios, but I'm going to use it to go somewhere else. This little spot over here for Joffrey's has the the frozen toffee fight by Twix and it is the best frozen drink at at Disney in my opinion. It's so so stinking good. So, you know, hop on the the Skyliner and go grab a delicious treat. Count me in. [Music] Reggie is served. Right. Got the girls situated with a little breakfast snack before we head down. Just been tidying up the room. So, they're like, I'm starving and let's just get a snack. So, Bella's eating a bit of my pink donut and Lucy's got some goldfish. So, we're kind of tidying them over. Dean has taken all the bags down to load the car. I don't want to leave this room. I love it so much. This is the part that I hate about driving is that I can come up with so many things and it's like, \"Oh, we could go to the pool and then we could shower and then we could leave or we could do this or we could do that.\" And I keep coming up with like all these things that we could do to not leave cuz I just I enjoy being here even though we've been here 2 weeks. I think it's so fun. Um I am excited though to get home. So I'm I'm a little torn. like I'm like I don't want to leave. But there's also part of me that's like I'm excited to get home. I'm excited to work on projects. I'm excited to edit these videos. And so it's like I'm excited in a lot of different ways, but it is beautiful. It's absolutely beautiful. I've definitely got some inspiration for our home and bedroom after staying here, though. So, I'm excited. I'm like, maybe we can we can do some Disney inspired you don't know how to sail. Way to go. Now pull that rope and release the sail. Get trapped in that wall. [Music] [Music] You got to collect the red and green balls. No, I want to go with them. Hold on, girls. I got to read the instructions. [Music] Good job. And then I Nope. Now Bella goes first with the red ball and she's going to toss it. Bella, try to get try to get the red ball close to the white ball. You can toss it hard though. You'll need to. Look at that. Oh, too far. [Music] Oh, that's straight. [Music] He's excited to get up. [Music] 14. Oh, wow. [Music] [Music] Ready, set, go. When it comes to one of our family's favorite things to do at Riviera, it's these lawn games, yard games that they have, both the botchi ball, the um cornhole or I think bag toss, depending on where you're from, will depend on what you call it. But it is so fun. The kids always find friends. They actually got to play with some subscriber friends, which was really cool. So, it was so nice meeting some of you guys. So, if you were there and hanging out with us, thank you for being there. Appreciate it. That was so much fun. But, it is such a relaxing resort. And these things you actually don't have to be staying there to do. So, if you are at Caribbean Beach or you're wanting to do a Skyliner crawl, it's a great place to kind of relax and play and have a good time. And it is absolutely beautiful. The vibe is just so on point here. After about an hour of botchi ball playing with friends and hanging out, we're going to go. It's almost 11:30. Got ice for our water cups. We've got lunch. Dean and I both have a chicken Sammy and the girls have the pasta. Mom, do we have to take that? No, we got to go to the car. We got to go to the magical mommy mobile. I want to walk. I'm sorry, baby. You don't want to leave. Yeah. [Music] Yeah. [Music] Well, that is sadly going to do it for our last day here at the Riviera. We are getting ready to drive all the way back to Home Sweet Home. And yeah, I'm sad to be leaving. I I feel like on the inside like Bella on the outside was a moment ago. Um she's my spirit animal right now. Probably for a lot of us. It's just like I don't want to leave. It's just so fun. It's like, you know, you have to get back. You got to get back to the real world. You got to get back. But it's just so it's so fun and so wonderful being here. And she's not even crying cuz she's like the parks and this or that. She's like, I just want to go sit and ride the skylighter. That's like just the simple joys. Like she's not even looking for the like super stimulating, super exciting, fun things. She's just like, I just want to ride the Skyliner some more. I'm like, same, girl. Same. Frozen toffee flight and a couple Skyliner laps. I would be so down, but we do have to get going. So, we at least have road trip food. We stayed long enough that we could grab lunch cuz got to get one last chicken Sammy. Honestly, donuts. I know. I mean, we got one last thing. We did get one for the road. One for the road. But that's going to do it for the vlog. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you for watching. Thank you again to Kayla for hosting our night here at Riviera. So grateful. I will have all of her details down below if you're looking for an amazing travel agent. Again, I'll have her stuff linked down below. And that's the beauty of even having a travel agent is they can be as hands-on or hands off as you want them to be. And it's great. And it's also a great way to support someone else who loves Disney. And a lot of these, they're moms. They're working hard to stay home with their families and their babies and they're doing this. And I love being able to collaborate and help spread the word about people like that that are chasing their dreams and working hard and I just I love it. So definitely check Kayla out. But that's going to do it. Thank you into the video club. Thank you for following along. You guys will have to leave some French Riviera emojis down below. some blues, maybe some French flags, those sorts of things down in the comments. That way I know you're part of the secret end of the video club. And if you could spend one day at a resort to like cap your trip, what resort would it be? You have to let me know down in the comment section. But I'll see you in the next one. Bye, guys. No."

      "transcript": "Hey everyone, welcome back. And today I'm going to be talking through my packing for my trip to Walt Disney World. It's just a few days away until I leave for this trip. I'll be traveling with one of my friends and you'll find out who that is very shortly when the vlogs begin. We're going to be staying in Walt Disney World at Allstar Sports for this one. We've got a preferred room this time. So hopefully we'll be quite close for the buses and for refilling your refillable mug. Very important. If you know, you know if you've been before. And on this trip we'll be going to Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween party. We've got a reservation at the new Beacon Barrel Pirates Tavern in the Magic Kingdom. We also have a reservation over at GO82, which is the Spaceship Perth Lounge in Epcot. Although Spaceship Perth itself is closed for refurbishment, but we'll get a little bit of a Spaceship Perth fix hopefully by visiting the new lounge, which I've never done before. We're also going to get to see the new Starlight Parade in the Magic Kingdom. That's the new nighttime parade, and there hasn't been one for such a long time. I used to love the Main Street Electrical Parade and Spectro Magic. I've been visiting Walt Disney World for 23 years now and it's been such a long time since we've had a nighttime parade. I'm really excited to see that. Tron is having a new overlay in the Magic Kingdom with different lighting, different music, and we're going to be experiencing that. There is just so much coming up. So, do make sure you subscribe if you're not already because you're not going to want to miss that. In this video, I'm going to take you through everything that I'm going to be packing for this trip. So, all of my outfits, shoes, accessories, bags. Then I'm going to go through my hand luggage and toiletries, beauty products. So, if you have a trip to Walt Disney World coming up or a trip anywhere for that matter, packing tips can always be useful. There's so many different things that you do need for a Disney World trip. And like I said, I've been going for a long time. This is my 37th trip, I think, I worked out to Walt Disney World. So, over the years, I've really refined what I do need, what I don't need. I used to pack all kinds of things that were just pointless. So, hopefully this will help you if you have a trip coming up or you're hoping to book one. Hopefully this will help you with your planning. We're going to be flying with Norse Airlines for the first time this trip. They did used to be Norwegian Air. So Norse bought out Norwegian Air. And I used to fly with them a lot when it was Norwegian. It's the same planes, so I'm assuming everything is going to look largely the same and the experience I'm kind of imagining will be. So it' be really good to show you what that's like. It is a more budget airline and we did get our flights for a very good price for this trip. Because it is a budget airline. I have heard from some people that they are more strict on things like hand luggage weight and sizes than British Airways or Virgin Atlantic if you're flying from the UK. I must admit I don't normally run into many issues with them weighing hand luggage suitcases. They do sometimes depending on how busy the flight is, but not on a regular basis. So, with that in mind, I have gone on the safe side with my hand luggage and gone for smaller than I would normally take, just so that I don't run into any trouble with it being too big or being overweight. You can still take one cabin item and then a personal item being like a small handbag or a laptop case or something. So, I'll show you the small bag that I'm going to be taking, but in terms of my actual main cabin bag, I've got this one. And this is a new one for me. This is actually the travel hack is the brand. And I'm going to show you exactly what I put inside here and how I pack it all and everything, but this one is a lot smaller than the dimensions of what you can take. You can take like a normal cabin case on wheels, but I'm just going to take this with me. I do have a small cabin case, which I'm certain would be within the size that they allow, but I'm actually happy just taking the rucksack because I do have a big suitcase with all of my main checked items in it. So, I'm going to show you everything that goes in there. And like I said, I'll run through all my beauty products and everything as well. I do have my wash bag ready to go. And I probably will turn the camera around to actually show you all of this cuz it's easier for me to show you as I'm putting stuff in. But look at this wash bag. This is so cute. I've had this for years now. I believe I got it in around I want to say 2013 or something like that. Maybe it was a little bit later. I got it from Disney Springs in the Trendy store. I think it's called Trend Trendy. You know the one I mean it's in the old marketplace section of Disney Springs. That's where I got it. They had this one and a Montreal one, but it was such a long time ago. And the Magical Express doesn't even exist anymore. So, I love that I've got this little um wash bag that I can take. So, I'll be showing you everything that I'm putting in there. I'll just show you a few items of makeup that I think are particularly useful and relevant for Florida. But let's turn the camera around and then I can start getting on with showing you everything I'm taking and how I pack it. I've got all the stuff laid out here in terms of outfits and accessories. Like I said, I'm going to show the other stuff separately, but I thought I would do outfits first. I've actually got quite a lot of t-shirts and shorts this time rather than just dresses and playsuits. I've just had a bit of a love for t-shirts all of a sudden, and I've got some really good ones for this trip. First up, I have this one, the Everything is Better at Walt Disney World. This one I actually got from Walt Disney World a couple of trips ago. And to go with these t-shirts, I have these shorts that actually look more like a skirt. I got these from Amazon. I've got pink and black. They're elasticated around the waist. They will need an iron before I wear them. Just open them out a little bit so you can see. So yeah, they are shorts there, but the way that all of this kind of flows down, it looks much more like a skirt. So with this one, I could wear the pink or the black shorts. Then I have the Rope Drop Club t-shirt. This was very kindly gifted to me by Laura from Magic Maker Ears. I'll probably do the pink shorts and these pink ears, which were also gifted by Magic Maker Ears. Then I have this Spice Girl t-shirt, which I absolutely love because it is more of an autumn Halloweeny kind of trip. I just really wanted something like this. I knew exactly what I wanted and I couldn't really find it. So, I actually designed this t-shirt myself and had it made. I was really pleased with myself. And then wear it with these fluffy ears, which are also from Magic Maker Ears. They're definitely more kind of autumn or winter type of ears and I think those will be great with that. And then I have this t-shirt which says current mood popcorn. This was another one that I designed myself. I've kind of got a bit into t-shirt designing. If anyone loves these and wants to get one, I can probably make them available on a limited run. And this one I'm going to do probably with the black shorts definitely with this bag. I can't wait to wear this bag with that t-shirt and I'll also do the red ears with that. So I really can't wait to wear that outfit. Then in terms of dresses and playsuits and things, I've got the red dress with the lemons. And I would definitely do these bright yellow ears with that one. These are from Magic Maker ears. I've got the black dress with the hearts on that I wore on my last trip. That one is actually a backup. So I do have enough outfits for the whole trip. There's a couple of t-shirts actually that are not here yet. Um so I wasn't able to show them in this video, but I've got two more t-shirts I think. So this is one that I'm taking as a spare, but I always take some spare outfits. Then I have this dress which also has like lemons and flowers and these ears will go with that one also. I've got my trusty mint green playsuit is one of my absolute favorites and I love these ears with it so much. So that's going to be another outfit. And then I have this black dress with the rainbow hearts that I got from Vintage. And I'll be wearing these bright pink ears with this one. I think those go perfectly. And these were very kindly gifted to me by Ears Ever After. I'll link both them and Magic Maker Ears below. And I do have a pair of black ears here as well. that these I'm going to be wearing to Mickey's not so scary Halloween party. And one of the t-shirts that is missing is the ones that I'm wearing with these ears to the Halloween party. I've also got a pair of leggings there. Those are to put on to travel home in. I'll change into those when I get to the airport cuz it's too hot for leggings in Orlando at the moment. So, in terms of bags, I've got the popcorn one you've already seen. I'm going to bring this red one just in case I want to wear that with the red lemon dress or the red heart dress. It's very small, so I figured I'd just bring it anyway. And I also have these two bags. I'm very much going in the direction this trip of cross body bags. So I've got this one here in a cream color and then I have this black one. I've decided rather than Loungefly bags. I do love my Loungefly bags. I've not gone off them and I will definitely use them on future trips. But I really do need something that just makes it very easy for me to grab stuff quickly. I'm always switching between my camera and my phone. I need to be able to just grab them and not have to keep taking a backpack off. So, I've decided to try out using these on this trip. This little hole at the top, by the way, is to put your headphone cord through because I actually do use wired headphones most of the time. Then for shoes, I've got my black Converse, which are just my absolute go-to. They're so comfortable for me walking around the parks. I just always have to have them. And then I have my pink Jordans as well. Those will go nicely with the pink skirt and a few of the outfits I'm going to be wearing this trip. And just going back to the subject of bags, I have a few bag charms here. These two little ear ones are from Magic Maker Ears. She now does little bag charms, which is the cutest thing. So, when I'm going around, like with this bag, I can clip that on the front. I also have Spice here. I've got Gingi as well somewhere. I need to find Gingi. But Spice is definitely going to be perfect for the day where I wear the Spice Girl t-shirts, and I'll be able to put Spice on the bag. So, that's just really cute. And of course, I'm bringing Bumble as well. I've got three pairs of glasses here. I've got my normal aviator ones at the top there. Then I've got those ones with the flowers on the edge. They're one of my favorite pairs that I've had for years. They don't sell them anymore, I don't think. They were from Boohoo. And then I've got this pair at the front, which is a much more bright kind of purple pair. Then I have my Cinderella Magic Band. I actually have so many Magic Bands in my owner's locker. I'm not sure if I'm going to get my owner's locker out this time because I've got all the shoes, bags, and ears that I need. That's mostly what's in it. So, I think I'll get it out when I go in November, but I just don't think there's any need to bother this time. But, I've got that magic band. I can just wear that one with everything. Then, I've got several of these snag shorts. These are really good underneath dresses. It's just much more comfortable walking around all day, getting on and off rides if you've got these underneath. Underwear here. Then, I've got several pairs of pajama shorts. I've got one t-shirt there. I always bring my old Epcot Forever t-shirt. It's just so old now, but I love it. And I'm going to add a couple more t-shirts that are in the wash just to wear for bed. And then I've got some socks here. And again, I've got all of my little trainer socks in the wash. So, I will put those in also. This just has my swimwear inside. I very rarely have time to go swimming when I'm on these trips to be honest, but I always bring it just in case. I have a bottle of my iced coffee that I'm going to put in the suitcase. I can't put this in my hand luggage because it's too big over the 100 mil. I'm so obsessed with this iced coffee. I'm just going to take my own thermal iced coffee mug. I'm gonna take this. Then I can buy some milk in the grocery store when we get there and I can just have iced coffees in the room. The Disney hotels have lots of ice machines, so I'll be able to just make my iced coffee. Then I'll have no need for my kettle and my coffee pot and everything that's in the owner's locker. I'll just take this with me. I'm currently totally obsessed with this. And then I have my Pandora bracelet and just another little headband, a non- ear one just in case I want that. I've got my J Havanas. Again, I very rarely wear them unless I go to the pool, but I bring them in case. And my hat. This does need a clean before I put it in, but I always bring that for travel day back in case my hair is a bit less than stellar. And I have my Beauty Works curling iron. And I will put my straighteners in as well, but I need those obviously before I go. Those are probably the only two hair tools that I'll take. I won't take my waiver this time. I sometimes mix it up and take that, but this time I think I'll just do curly or straight. So, that's pretty much everything for outfits. Like I said, I've got a couple of t-shirts to add. I've got another pair of these black shorts to add in, a couple more t-shirts for bed, and the straighteners. So, in terms of actually getting everything packed into the suitcase, I always use packing cubes. Packing cubes to me are now an essential. I could not just put all of this stuff in the suitcase and put the straps over it and just hope for the best cuz it all gets creased. it all drops to the bottom and goes everywhere. I just can't do that. I'm a packing cube person all the way now. And I have a few different types. I love my level eight ones, which are these gray ones. Then I have this set as well. This was a set I actually was given by the Disney PR team. So, it's got Disneyland, Walt Disney World, and Cruise Line on there. I will link a very similar set to this below. Then, I have my underwear packing cube. You might have seen some of these things in a recent prepping video that I did. I've had this for ages. This is probably done. I don't know how many trips and it's still going strong. So, I'll link all of this below. I have this little Disney cruise line cube pouch thing. This one I just have for putting little bits and pieces in. Then I have this really small pouch. Says Disney is Calling. This is from Liberty Lane Designs. I'll link this below as well. This is just for putting really small things in. I'm going to start by putting the bag charms in here. Spice can go in there as well. Goodbye and Bumble. And in the Disney Cruise Line cube, I've just got my phone holder. I need this when I do live streams. Got several plug adapters for the US. Then I've got an ordinary UK one as well, just in case I need to plug a cable into an actual plug and then into one of these, if that makes sense. And the magic band can go in there, too. Ears will all go into this drawstring bag. And I normally put them in like this. So, one pair up and one pair down. And you can get more in that way. [Music] And then I've just got a smaller one that these last two pairs can go into. [Music] Then I'm going to use the level eight one to put the pajama bottoms, the bras, the snag shorts, and the socks and everything in cuz they're a bit bulkier. [Music] It's surprising what you can fit in there. That didn't look as if it was going to fit all of that, but it did. Time for the clothes to go in. And I'm going to use this biggest one first. [Music] [Music] Those are all in. And there's plenty of room in both of these, but especially in this one, to put the other t-shirts I've still got to come and the pajama tops. This bag I'll be taking with me on travel day, so I'll leave that one out. Oh, I just found my Animal Kingdom glasses in the popcorn bag. I love these. I've had them so many years. I think they were Primark, but literally like 10 years ago. The strap is unruly on this one. So, the other few bits that you saw are going to be either going in my hand luggage or the havas I'll just throw into the case as they are. But once you have everything like this in cubes, it is so much easier to then just put this in the suitcase. Obviously, I'll have beauty products and toiletries. I'm going to take you through that shortly and show you what kind of bags I put those in and stuff. With my vlogging equipment, most of that will go into my hand luggage, which I'm going to show you separately as well. But for putting things in the suitcase, I just find this so much better than having things loose. And then each of these can just be popped into the suitcase. I did forget to pop this in. This definitely can't go in the hand luggage. It's a brand new sealed bottle. So, there's no reason that this should leak. But let's not risk that. And I'm going to put it into one of these IKEA Ziploc bags just to be on the safe side cuz I don't want that rolling around on its own without being sealed in a bag. And I'm just going to pop this in here with the handbag. There's a perfect little space for it there. Time to get everything into the suitcase. And this is my level eight suitcase. I absolutely love it. It's a hard shell case. There's so much space in it because you have these kind of zip covers that go over either side. It does keep everything in there perfectly. I'll link this suitcase below and I do have another one with them as well that I love. So, really, really good quality luggage. I've had no problems with it. No breakages. Really, really sturdy. The wheels are amazing. So, yeah, I can't say enough good things about this. Let's start putting it all in. [Music] So, that is all easily fitted in there, and there's still plenty of room for me to put some bits in. It looks like it's quite full, but there's actually tons of space still in there. Okay, on to hand luggage now. And like I showed you earlier, this is the bag that I'm going to be using. The thing I love about this one, it unzips around there on the front and opens up like this. So, you can leave it standing like that. It's easy to put your stuff in. You have all these pockets on the front. And then there's a laptop pocket at the back. So I really just liked the design of this. And like I said, it is small enough that it's the underseat size. So it's much smaller than it needs to be. I could have gone a bit bigger, but just for the avoidance of taking something too big, this I think is going to be perfect. I've just put a bit of light on there. Hopefully you can see a little bit better now. And this little pocket at the top here, if you unzip this, you can put your phone inside and it kind of goes into that pocket just to keep your phone safe. It's so new, I haven't even taken the tag off yet. And then on the side here, this is where your laptop goes in the back. And this is padded. And just to show you, this is going to be my personal item. I did briefly show this, but this is just a little cross body bag. So, I'm going to have these two items basically as carry-on. I'll start with these pockets, I think. And into this bottom one, I'm going to put all the sunglasses. I think I've even gained a few more pairs since I last showed you. And I am just throwing them in here like this. A lot of people are probably horrified if you have expensive sunglasses. All of these are dead cheap. I don't buy expensive sunglasses, and I don't actually find that they do get that scratched just putting them in like that. So, that's absolutely fine. In this top one here, I'm going to put my power bank, which has just lit up. The little paw print actually tells you how much power is left. This is a really good powerful one, though. I've got this one and the easy one. I love both, and they're both equally as powerful, I find. So, I'm going to pop that in there. And I have one of these cables which is USB on the end and then you've got all three different types of chargers on. Next will be this. This is actually the carry case for the Osmo, but the Osmo I always have with me because it's what I'm always vlogging on. So, this is going to have the Canon camera in it and the extra batteries and stuff. The Canon I'm currently using to film on at the moment, but it will go in there and just sit inside here. I've got my Britta water bottle, which I've just put a brand new filter into. This is so great for Orlando. It totally takes away the gross taste of the water. You can fill it up from the sink in your room or the water fountains and you just can't taste any horrible tastes. It is absolutely perfect. I'm going to put this into the side pocket. I have an umbrella. This is just my really small one. I love this one for the parks cuz it just folds up tiny. Then I have the Flow Zoom travel pillow. This is the best travel pillow ever. This is actually Paul's and when we go on our trip next time I'm going to get a second one for me. It's an inflatable one and it has this bar in the middle. So you can either lean forward on it or you can have your head resting back. Paul absolutely loved it. It's even got a hood attached to it so you can cover over your eyes. It's just so good. We absolutely love this. Like I said earlier, I will link all of these things below. Then I have my snack bag. I love this thing. It's got plenty of space in it and because we're flying with Norse and I don't think they do feed you as much on the plane, you don't get as many snacks and drinks. So I'm bringing my own. I've got some of these fruit snack things that you get from Little. I absolutely love those. Got some cereal bars, I do have some Haribo in the back as well. I'm actually going to pop that at the back there and then put that in on top. In terms of tech items, as well as taking the Canon, which will be in there, then the Osmo camera I'll have on me. This is the tripod that I use, the Yulanzi one. And I have the extra battery handle on here that comes with the Osmo Vlogger kit. So then when you put the camera on top and you can open out this tripod then when you're in restaurants it's the perfect kind of eye level on the table for filming. Then I've got my new eye mask and it's one of these that has like the padding around so if you do have like eye makeup on and stuff it doesn't totally ruin your makeup. Obviously you'll get a little bit of it around here but I thought that was really good. But the actual point of this is that it causes it to be blackout so you don't get any light coming through. I did test it out and it works really well. So very very happy with that. And at the last minute, like I say, I will put my phone in there. I will put my laptop in the back. And then in this little gap in the top, I will also have my laptop charger. And as well as my phone, in this pocket at the top, I will put my passports. I don't want to put it in this front pocket. I know it's super paranoid, but I feel like somebody could unzip it and take it out. It does have this thing over the top. I feel like it is so unlikely, but you just never know when you're traveling. I would rather have it in this top one. Oh, and the one other thing that will go in here at the last minute is my fan. and my EAC fan. I always just put that in the backpack just in case when I get there it's super hot and I need it right away. In terms of makeup, I'm not going to go through everything, but a few things of note um just in case you're wondering. The eyeshadow I'm going to be using is the Urban Decay Naked Smokey Palette. I don't think you can still get this. Makeup Revolution do a similar one. Um but this is the one that I'm going to be using on this trip. I like the Naked original palette as well, but the one I've got I've almost run out of. That's the sort of shades you can see in this one. I'll also be taking this new L'Oreal Infallible 3 Second setting mist. I've currently been testing this. I'm going to let you know exactly what I think about it on my Instagram stories once I've done a couple of days in Orlando. I just need to test it in the extreme heat first. The foundation I use is the Laura Mercier Flawless Lumiere Radiance Perfecting in shade beige. This is a brand new one cuz I'd almost run out, but I love this foundation for Florida. I also use the Laura Mercier Real Flawless Concealer and this is in shade 1C1. Absolutely love that. The powder I use over the top is the Beauty Pie One Powder Wonder. I love this stuff. And I did mention in my most recent Victoria in Detail vlog that I was trying out a new lipstick. This is the Kiko lipstick in vintage rose. That's the shade. I actually was wearing it in the intro to this video earlier. And the lip liner is the Rimmel Lasting Finish. This is in shade pink candy. So, the two of these together I really, really like and definitely most days while I'm in Orlando, I'll be using those. Okay, I've got the beauty products and toiletries and everything in the Magical Express bus now. So, I'll take you through this and show you what's in here. It's got one of these um things on the top, which I like as well cuz it opens out quite wide so you can see everything inside. It even has detail on the back. Look at the characters in the back of the bus. I'm just obsessed with this. I do have most of it in here now, but there are a few things that I haven't thrown in yet just because I still need them before I go. But this will give you a good idea of pretty much everything. First up with the basics, toothbrush. And I like to put these little topper things on to keep them from touching anything else. Toothpaste. I really like this Superdrug Proare whitening instant whitening toothpaste. It actually goes really quite dark blue on your teeth, which is a bit weird when you're using it, but I do find it quite effective for whitening. And I do also have my high smile serum as well. I have started using that on my teeth and it does a really good job of whitening it. So, I just didn't want to go the whole trip without doing it. I normally only do this a couple of times a week. Um, but I thought I would bring this along. It doesn't take up too much room. Then I've got hairspray. This is just the Tresomeme extra hold. I have a Garnier Ultralift sheet mask in here. I just like to take one with me sometimes when you're away. the air conditioning and being on the plane and all those sorts of things and the sun can make your skin a bit drier. So, partway through the trip, I just like to do one of those on an evening before I go to sleep. Speaking of sun, I have my sunscreen. This is an SPF 30. It's just the spray-on one. And I have a miniature version, the Banana Boat Sport. That's also a 30. And both of these I actually got in Orlando last time I was there. Sunscreen is one of the most important things when you go to Florida. I'm going to talk about my one that I use on my face as well when I talk about the makeup. Um, but just always have your SPF on your face, on your body, everywhere. It's so easy to burn and if you get burned at the beginning of the trip, it just totally ruins the rest of it. And sunburn is just so bad for you. So, always make sure you've got your sunscreen on. Another thing that's super important in the sweaty heat is deodorant. And I've got my Wild deodorant. I've partnered with Wild for several years now. I love Wild deodorant, which is the refillable one. And they've actually recently started doing rollons. So, I have the roll on and the stick one as well, and I thought I would try them both out in the really strong Florida heat, so I can report back on that. I always just have my little pair of travel scissors in here. This actually looks more like a pen, but if you take the lid off and just push it up, it's a little pair of scissors. These ones were actually from Eron Condrin, but you can get them on Amazon. I'll link them below. Um, they're really inexpensive, but they're so good for travel. I've got a set of my favorite lashes in here, which are the Samantha ones from Huda Beauty. They're not cheap. I only really wear these when I'm in Florida. Sometimes when I'm filming or a night out, special occasion or something like that and they're not ones that I would wear all the time because they are pricey, but I just love these ones. Then I've got my little travel razor. And I normally use bar soap for showering and in the bath and just general usage. But when I go to Florida, I do just use a small bottle of shower gel. And this is the Olay Sheia Butter. This is the one that I do buy in Orlando. And I buy my bars of soap from there as well because they do this exact same one in the bar soap. But for this trip, I just take this along. Um it's a lot easier than taking like a soap and a soap dish and all that kind of thing. For my hair, I've got my shampoo. This is the Beauty Works clarifying shampoo. This is really, really good for keeping blonde hair from going that kind of orangey, peachy, brassy kind of look when it looks a bit yellow. Um this one is great for that. Normally I decant it into a small bottle, but I didn't think this bottle was actually that big. So, I'm just going to take it as it is cuz I've got room for it. Then, I've got a miniature version of the Beauty Works 10-in-1 Miracle Spray. This is the leave-in conditioner that I use. This is excellent. It acts as a heat protectant and it makes it a lot easier to brush through and it just makes your hair soft and moisturized. It's amazing. I love this stuff. I've got a refill of my Bath & Body Works hand sanitizer cuz I've got one of the holders hanging on one of my bags and then I've just bought an extra one in case it runs out. Plasters, very important. Sometimes you can get blisters when you are walking around the theme parks loads, even if you've broken in your shoes. I have had pairs of shoes that are otherwise absolutely fine, really start to hurt my feet or rub when I'm in Florida. So, I always bring these. And because I bring the little scissors, I can just cut these to size. I've just got some of these tablets. These are the mucinx they're called. They're really good if you get a cold. I have on occasion, if you've been watching me for a long time, you will know this. Picked something up while I'm out in Florida. And if you just get like a common kind of standard cold where you're bunged up, these are absolutely brilliant. So, I threw those in as well, just in case. I don't want to jinx anything, but it's better to be prepared than not. And those type of things are really expensive to buy when you're over there as well. So, I thought I'd bring those with me. I have a little travel jar here with my ibuprofen in cuz I buy the big jars when I'm out in Florida and then I just decant them into here to take with me. Then, I've got my V5 instant volume hair powder. This is just a little pot of powder that you can sprinkle in around the top of your hair and it just kind of boosts it up a little bit. If your hair is quite flat, it just adds a bit of volume. It's especially good if you've just washed it and you know when it's really soft and it just won't do anything. It's really good then to put a bit of this just through the top. My dry shampoo is so large it won't actually fit into the wash bag. So, I just put that in separately. I do get the big one because I use a lot of dry shampoo. As you can see, I have a lot of hair and I don't like to wash it too often while I'm in Florida because it's just such a long process washing hair when you have extensions. So, I use dry shampoo in between and I just like to make sure I don't run out. Dry shampoo in America is so much more expensive than here. I can't remember. I think I paid £3.99 for this on offer. When I've been in Target before, their bottles of dry shampoo were like $13 or something. and I was absolutely stunned how expensive it was. So, never ever rely on buying dry shampoo when you're out there. I would take it with you if I were you. The other hair things that I don't have in here are my hair brush because I'm still obviously using it before I go. And I do need to put some conditioner in. I'll probably just decant some into a small bottle cuz I don't have a separate one. Then I've got my moisturizer. I've got the travel version of the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream. I absolutely love this moisturizer. It is pricey though, so I don't necessarily use it all the time. I've got another one that I use here at home. I'll put it on the screen what it's called and I'll link it below. The one that I use every day, but because I've got a small one of these, I'm just going to take this with me. And I also have my Renew and Me night treatment, which is currently on my bedside table. I need to put that in as well. I use that every single night. And also my eye cream. I use the E.L.F. Hydro Boost Eye Cream. So, I'll link that as well. But those I just need to throw in at the last minute, but I'm still using them. In the bottom here, I've also just got a couple of little hair elastics in case I do put my hair up. I need to throw a couple of bigger ones into. I'll also throw in some hair grips at the last minute and makeup remover. That's the other thing that I need to add, but I'm still using it. The other random thing that I always have in my wash bag, this is so weird, is a teeny tiny screwdriver. I always bring this because my Canon camera, sometimes the flipup screen, the screws get loose and then it rattles around and makes a noise. I don't always use my Cannon anymore. That's the one I'm using here. Um, but I do sometimes use it and I always need to bring this with me cuz they do come loose. So, that's a really random thing that's always in there as well. One last thing that I do need to throw in is the bug spray. I did buy some recently. So, that will also go in here. So, that is going to do it for this packing video. I hope this has been useful to you in terms of items that you might need when you go on your Disney trip, things you might not have thought of, and how I actually pack it into the suitcase and into the hand luggage. Um, like I said, there's so many different things to remember when you're going on a Disney trip. It's a lot more than when you just do maybe like a regular beach holiday. I just feel like there's so many more little things that you need. So, I hope you guys found this helpful. Like I said at the beginning of the video, don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already. There is so much to come. I can't wait to get out there now and make these vlogs, share everything with you, show you all of our experiences. I'm really, really excited now. I can't wait. So, thank you guys so much for watching as always and for taking the time out of your day. Don't forget to follow along on Instagram as well because I will be posting over there in real time while we're on the trip. I hope you're all well and having a great day and I'll see you in the next one. Bye. [Music] [Music]"

      "transcript": "I'm just going to give it a second for everyone to arrive. And we've got enough light here. I think we're okay. Um Kefir, plan my Sunday around this. Can't wait. Hi. Let me know if you can hear me as well. Um hopefully the sound is okay. Might be a tiny bit echoey cuz I've got the door shut, but yeah, let me know if you can hear me. All right. Just going to get the comments up here so I can see you all. Hi Victoria. Hi Sophia. And hopefully the comments will kind of uh keep up. How is everyone? It has been a minute since we have done a live stream, hasn't it? Hi Sophie. Hi Desiree. Hello. Sometimes it takes a minute for the comments to to come of me to see things. I'm starting to see everybody now. Hi Harriet, Lauren Cook, Amy, hi Amy, Emma, Jen, Kora, Dina. I'll try and say hi to everybody, but if you start coming thick and fast, I might not be able to keep up. Um, your your typical fairy tale, Louise, John, Rachel, Zoe, Candace, Todd, hi Todd, Cynthia. Hi, Cynthia. Hi, Julia. Angie, yeah, it's been so long since you've done a live stream. And because I haven't got any vlogs for the next couple of weeks, I have got videos that are going up, by the way. There will be some more content. Um, hi Chris. Hi Sara, Leanne, Bonnie. So, I thought we'd do a little live stream catch up tonight. It's a bank holiday weekend here in the UK, so probably quite a few people have got tomorrow off. Hi, Kefir. So yeah, I thought it'd be nice to just have a little Disney chat because it has been a while. Shout out Stephanie, Jill and Chris, Tanya. Um Tanya is American but in London. Um how's life? Really good. Amazing but busy. Is anyone else finding that time? I know we always say this, but really really this year time is just zooming by, especially this summer. Hi, I'm Marie who's in the UK. Lucy, Shannon, Poppy. Hi. So nice to talk to all you guys. I know we used to do these live streams a lot um in 2020 and 2021. The year is going. I know it's just absolutely crazy. Um Zoe is off to Florida two weeks today. May there are so many people going in September, like around two weeks from now. Um, hi Joanne. I think it's just that kind of time of year cuz the Halloween stuff is really starting to kick in. Although, has everybody seen is basically already started. So, Disney starts Halloween early. Amy is off on the fantasy next week. Oh my goodness. Amazing. Which um sailing are you doing? Like which itinerary? I want to do another cruise so bad. Like doing the cruise was one of the best things I've ever done. Ke is going in two weeks. Um told hoping the weather cools down. It's been brutally hot. Yeah, it is honestly like this year and last year I feel like has been so hot. Was it in obviously May Paul and I were there was absolutely like the hottest May I have ever experienced. Um Dina is saying when are you going? So, I'm going in a couple of weeks time. So, I'm going to be going for all the Halloween festivities, doing the Halloween party. Um, also there's some new things. So, we've got both of the new shows in Hollywood Studios to do. There's GO82, the Spaceship Earth Lounge. Got a reservation for that. Um, Beacon Barrel, the new Pirates Tavern in Magic Kingdom. Going to be doing that as well. Um, the new Starlight Parade. All of that is going to be coming in the vlogs. And, um, I'll probably live stream some of those things as well. Um, hi Leanne who's going in 33 days. That is not long. Port Orleans Riverside. Amazing. Absolutely love that. U Thank you, John. Pumpkins on Main Street last week, but everything. I just love the Halloween decorations. Magic Kingdom with Halloween decorations is just beautiful. Um, weather is really really nice right now um at Disney and going to the Halloween party tonight. Amazing. Have a great time, Jennifer. I'll be there beginning or end of November. Um, I think it's like second kind of second week of November, Paul and I will be going back and he's going to get to experience Christmas in the parks. We'll be doing the Very Merry Christmas party. And so, yeah, really excited for that. We'll be going back to Epic Universe to do our kind of doover day where it was a bit hit and miss last time with the attractions being closed on that preview. So, we're really excited for that. Um, Poppy went in December and I was freezing. Never been cold in Florida. I'm really hoping it's cooler. It was so so cold in January this year. That's actually the coldest I've ever experienced in Orlando. Um I remember walking into Epcot one morning and my face was just frozen. Like it was honestly so cold. But I do love it cuz I can walk around all day when it's that cool. It's amazing. Um some people do love the heat and humidity. Definitely Joe. I know. Absolutely. Lisa is like that. Lisa is obsessed. She the hotter the better. She absolutely loves it. Um Nicola is going on Tuesday. Hi from Bristol. Hi Sarah. Not too far from us there. Um 18 days for Nikki solo trip. Love a solo trip. Amazing. G saying strange to see you on TV. I can actually send a message to you. It's like meeting a celebrity. Ah, it's actually really nice doing these live streams because although I love your comments on the vlogs, it's so nice to be able to chitchat. And when we were doing this in 2020, it was like three times every week um we had those live streams. And I know a lot of us, myself included, like relied on those for just getting through that weird weird time. So, it's really nice to do one of these again. Um Todd St. Todd stayed at the yacht club in July and it was fabulous. Steakhouse is incredible. Yeah, yachtsman steakhouse. That's one that I've got on the list for when Paul and I go in November because I really want him to experience that. Do they still have those? some little garlic uh bread roll things. Do they still have those cuz they're amazing. Um Shell's going 18th of November. Um do I have any plans for Disneyland Paris? Yes. It all went a little bit ary with Disneyland Paris. It was supposed to be this summer. So I was going to go in June or July. And what ended up happening when we got back from the May trip, that um month of June was the busiest month I can remember having for various reasons. So, we were looking for a place to live, which we're now in, as you can see. Um, but that was all happening. I had loads and loads of videos and things that I was doing over on Victoria in detail, and I was editing the May vlogs that Paul and I had just done. Um, so June, I literally did not have time to go anywhere. It was absolutely crazy. And then we got this place and we moved at the beginning of July. So then we were moving in here and doing all of that. So I just actually genuinely haven't had chance to go to Disneyland Paris over the summer and um now we're in August and now obviously I've got September for Disney World and November. I really wanted to do Christmas this year in um not actual Christmas but the Christmas season in Disney World and I really wanted Paul to experience that. So, Disneyland Paris, I think now is most likely going to be March. So, let me know if that's a good time to go because I'm not very um up on when is a good time to go to Disneyland Paris. Um, hi Louise from Scotland. Hello Edgar. Um, will you dare go on Stardust Races? I might do. Paul definitely won't because he does not go upside down on rides. So, he just will not do that. But, I think I could probably do I like to do everything once. So, I've done Tarot of Terror before. I have done the Hulk before. I have done all of those, but I've only ever do things that terrify me once. So, I probably will do Stardust races at least once. Um, hi Emily. Hi Laurel. Um, will I ever move to Florida? Probably not to be honest. Um, for a couple of reasons. One, well, a few reasons actually. One, it would be too hot for me the whole year. Um, I do love going to Florida, of course, but I think I would struggle with the heat all the time. Um, secondly, it's really not easy to move to the US from the UK. Um, it's actually quite difficult to do and um, I would just miss family members too much. So, I'm I'm happy happy that I get to visit so much. It's absolutely amazing. Um, love watching your vlogs. Um, I've always wanted to go but can't due to disability. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Shannon. And I'm glad that the vlogs give you a bit of Disney magic um, when you can't be there. That's what I try to do. So, I know a lot of people for various reasons um can't go, so I try to take you guys along with me um when I go on these trips. Um they did have the rolls with the roasted garlic. Thank goodness for that, Todd. They are the best things ever. Um Kerry saying, \"Which of the Allstars do you prefer?\" I asked you guys this question on Instagram. I think my favorite so is between two. I think the theming is the best at allar movies. Um but I do think that Allstar Sports is probably my favorite. I've stayed there the most and I just I don't know. I really like sports for some reason. Erin has booked for next um April, so 2026 doing a day at Epic. Amazing. Yeah, we can't wait to go back. Really, really want to do the Ministry attraction and the minecart attraction. And I noticed both of those have been added to the what's it called? Universal Express. Express Pass I think it's called. um whereas before I don't think they were included. So that's really good. Um Dina can't wait for the Christmas season in November yet. I'm so excited for Paul to see Disney at Christmas, for him to see the resorts, to see the Christmas party. Um just everything. I really can't wait for that. Um Emily's asking, \"Considering getting into DVC? Um do you have to go over to Walt Disney World in order to get the finance sorted out if you want a finance plan?\" I don't think that you do, as I understand it, because it's a long time ago that I actually bought in. So, it was 2013, so quite some time now. You used to be able to do it from the UK like over the phone, I believe. Um, maybe these these days you kind of email people. I don't know. But, um, I don't I don't know if you want to do the finance with Disney. That's a good question. I don't know whether you need to be there in person. Um, I don't know on that one, but I'll try and find out for you because there's so many DVC um like booths around the parks. I can ask them when I go and I will let you know um in the vlogs. Um, how am I doing? Amazing. Thank you, Cla. Really, really good. Um, we're so happy in our new home here and there's just so much going on, so much exciting stuff. So, yeah, everything is great at the moment. Um, Tilly is going end of October for Halloween and Christmas. That is such a good technique to go so you just catch the end of Halloween and the beginning of Christmas. Then you kind of get all of that theming. Um I think it's hard to catch both parties though cuz I think the Christmas party doesn't begin until I don't know what the first one is. I want to say it's around the 10th or something. So it can be you have to be going long enough to like catch both. Uh Philipper is going to Disneyland Paris a week today. Amazing. Your videos have helped more than you can imagine. Thank you so much for saying that. I'm really glad that is what I do them for. And when I initially started the channel, it was really supposed to be more kind of information stuff, but I actually think over time I've been able to do both. So vlogs and giving information. I hope that's what I always try to do. Um Heather is going for a dream stay at the Contemporary. Amazing. My dream is a contemporary in the tower. Um a resort a park view, theme park view. I would love to do that. Uh Sarah is saying, \"My son William wanted to say hello.\" Hi, William. Um Amy saying, \"Minecart madness wrecked my back in April. It's rough.\" Oh my goodness. Okay, I'll brace myself for that. If I know that ahead of time, I can kind of like exactly that like brace ready for it. I find that from Space Mountain. That's why I don't ride Space Mountain. It like shakes my back around and I end up like feeling terrible for the rest of the day. Um, Kefir is saying they're doing Epic and have bought an express pass to make sure we get the most out of it. I'm wondering if we should do that, especially because they gave us the complimentary ticket to come back. I'm wondering whether Paul and I should do the express passes so that we can make sure we get to everything because obviously that didn't go according to plan last time. It was still great though because a lot of the rides were down. We did still get to see everything. That's what I really wanted to do in the vlog was just actually take you around the whole park. It's actually not massive. It's not a huge huge park to walk around. So, we were fairly easily able to do that. Um, am I doing Halloween Horror Nights? I'm actually not. Um, I had it booked last year if you guys remember, and then Storm Hela, I think it was, happened the night that I was supposed to be going. The reason I'm not this time, my travel buddy who's coming with me definitely doesn't want to do it. and I think Paul would really like it. So, my intention next year is to go and I think Paul will actually really really enjoy going. I'll still be terrified regardless, but it'll be good to have him there, but he'll absolutely love Halloween Horror Nights. So, yeah, we're going to save that and uh my first ever time doing it. It'll be good to do that with Paul, I think. But he'll he'll love it, I think. Um Samantha saying, \"Going to Disneyland Paris end of September. Will I be underwhelmed after Disney World?\" Do you know what? You have to just separate them, I think, and see them completely differently. They are very different. So, when I did I'm trying to think back to my first Disney Paris when I went with Becky and it was so cold. Um, which didn't help anything, but it's just a different experience to Disney World. Um, you wouldn't normally go for as long, so that's one thing. I feel like in Orlando there's so many other things. So, it's not just Disney. You've got Universal, you've got Bush Gardens, you've got Kennedy Space Center, your outlet shopping, like so many different things. I feel like Disneyland Paris, you're going really just for that and you probably do maybe like three three four days or something. So, it is very, very different. Um, but it's such a beautiful park. The Disneyland park and the castle and everything in Paris is just amazing. Uh, Todd is asking, \"Ho or boat house, which should be the priority?\" Oh, that you Todd, you knew that was going to be a really difficult question to answer. Um, okay. The comparison in my head is between Ho at any time of the day and Boat House brunch. If it was just between Boat House Dinner or Helo Dinner, then it would be Helo definitely. But Helo or Boat House brunch, I don't know cuz Boat House brunch is amazing. I'd probably still have to say Helo, but only just. But I absolutely do love Hello so much. Amy saying it's 100% rougher than Space Mountain. You've been warned. Oh my gosh. Really? Oh no. I'm really excited for that one though. The the minecart. That is pretty much the one I've been the most excited. Well, the Ministry probably the most. Um Louisa is saying, \"I've been watching since 2019.\" Hi Louisa. Thank you so much for watching. Um what lipstick do I have on? Brooke is asking. So, this is the what is it called? L'Oreal Matte Infallible Matte Liquid Lipstick. This shade is one that you can only get in the States, I believe, and it is called Road Tripping. Yeah, Road Tripping. That's it. I'm planning on getting another one because this is my absolute like everyday. I wear this lipstick constantly. Uh Kefir is staying at Stellanova for a week. Um Stellanova was so good for Epic. It is literally right there. You can just walk across. Theming wise, it wasn't my favorite. I think I slightly prefer Endless Summer over um Stellanova just overall. But it was really really good and so close to to epic. Uh there were eight Christmas parties um during the 14 nights that we're there. Yeah, there are so many now. Um do people get caught out by having to leave at 6:00 if they only have single day tickets? Yeah, it's definitely something that you need to plan for if you are not going to the parties. Having said that though, generally speaking, the party days are so quiet. So, if there's a party in the night, the daytime is so quiet. And when we were there last year, whenever it was a party day, you would go at like 10:00 in the morning, 11:00, midday, you're in the Magic Kingdom, and the wait times are so low. So, I think somebody who did only have a one-day ticket would be able to get a lot done um before people start showing up at like 4:00 onwards in the afternoon. So, it's it is a shorter day and you I'm yeah, you won't get the starlight parade, you won't get the fireworks. So, I wouldn't want to do my one day as as a party day definitely, but you actually can get quite a lot done. So, it is good in that respect. If you could walk around any Disney ride alone after closing, which would it be Haunted Mansion? 100%. I would love to be able to walk around. And I believe in Disneyland, unless I'm mistaken, they had a really special event where they had some kind of dinner in the Haunted Mansion. I'm sure I haven't invented that in my head. I'm sure that actually happened over in California. Let me know if anybody remembers that or if I'm completely inventing that. Um, so Tilly, we're not going for Christmas, but we are going for the Christmas season. So, we're going to be covering all the decorations in the park, at the resorts. Um, doing the party and everything. Um, staying at Port from the 11th of September. Um, when are we doing the party? I'm trying to think what date we are doing the party. I can't remember off the top of my head. Beacon Barrel we're doing right at the end of our trip. So, I believe I want to say the 16th I think that we're doing that. Um, at some of the resorts you can get the express included. Does that include Epic? That's a really good question, Carrie. I know that at um Portoino Bay, Royal Pacific, and Hard Rock you get the express passes included if you're staying there. I assume that would um include Epic, but I wouldn't want to say 100%, but I I think it probably would. Um, do you still have the wisdom plush of Jimny Cricket? Yes, I do, Philipper. I still have that. Um, fully grown woman cried from fear at Halloween Horror Nights. I think I got too into it. I'm going to be terrified. I just know I'm going to be absolutely terrified. It's going to be bad enough just walking around, but going in the houses, I would just be I don't know, just too too scared. I'm dreading it to be honest, but I know that Paul will love it. If I have time for one dinner at Disney Springs, which one would you recommend? My favorites are HO, as we just said. Um, for dinner, probably Ho, Raglin Road, and Homecoming are my favorites, I think, for dinner. Which one would I do if I could only do one? Ho, I think probably. I really like the food there. Such good food. Sorry, I'm just catching up in your comments here. Um, Poppy's saying, \"I've done Halloween and Christmas. Can't decide when to go back. Help me choose. I love both.\" Yeah, a lot of people have asked me, do I prefer Christmas or Halloween as in the parties? Um, it's so hard to say. I think overall I prefer the Halloween party as a whole. Um, just in terms of I love the Sanderson Sisters stage show. I think that is such a great show. I absolutely love it. The show at the Christmas party I don't care for at all. I think it's really bizarre quite honestly. Um I think it's something to do with I don't know about texting Santa on the phone or like Snapchat or something. I don't know. I just I just find that whole show just totally bizarre. The parades are great on both and the fireworks are great on both. It's really difficult and and obviously the Christmas magic is so good, but I think probably Halloween just pips it to the post in terms of the parties for me. Uh, will you be going on test track this trip? Yes, absolutely, Duncan. Definitely we will be. Um, can't wait to go on that. I've seen a few little clips of it and it does look pretty similar, but not. So, I'll be interested. I'll be really interested to see um how it's changed, what they've done. Oh, so it's only for Universal Studios and Islands, Maple Tree is saying. So, whoever was asking that, sorry, I've forgotten already. Um, it looks like the express pass is not included for Epic with the hotel stays by the sounds of things. Um, Helios doesn't give express passes, which surprised me. Oh, really? Doesn't it? That is actually very surprising. I would have thought if you were staying at Helios, you would get the express passes for Epic. like that would completely make sense as to why you would want to book there. So, I think they probably will do soon. It's it's still very new. So, that kind of makes sense. Uh, Starlight Parade is permanent. Yes, I believe so. And they don't tend to bring things. They do tend to change things more regularly these days. So, when you think about how long Wishes was running for, then we had um obviously Happily Ever After, then that kind of went away. We had something else. Then we got Happily Ever After back, whereas Wishes ran for goodness knows how long. Same for Illuminations at um Epcot. That went for years. So, they do change things up a little bit more, but we haven't had a nighttime parade for so long. I think Starlight will stay for for quite a while, probably. I hope so. It looks amazing. I'm just glad they've got a nighttime parade back to be honest. Um let's have a look here. Sorry, just catching up. Have you ever been to Flying Fish? No, I haven't. Actually, I'm not a big fish fan. Obviously, they do other things as well as fish, but Paul absolutely loves fish, so that might be the time to do it when I'm there with him, cuz he would probably love that. Uh Peter's saying, \"Have you been in February? If so, what is the weather like?\" Um, weather is, in my opinion, is great in January and February because it's so much cooler. January can actually be quite cold at times. So, if you don't like that, um maybe February or March would be better. But always watch out for spring break because when spring break especially starts up, that makes the parks really busy. Um but February is very good. Just avoid the Run Disney events. You can always go on to the Run Disney website and just double check you're not booking um right on when it's a race weekend cuz that makes things a little busy. But yeah, February weather is really nice. very very like mild, very very sort of um warm but not hot if that makes sense. Um is it true they're getting rid of early morning entry for Disney hotels only from January? Oh, I don't know. I haven't heard that. I hope not. They already got rid of the uh extra magic hours. So, I hope they're not getting rid of that. But it wouldn't surprise me. I mean, the Magical Express. On that note, sorry I just said Magical Express because I've been going through all my stuff that was in storage. Um, I found this the other day, which I haven't seen for so long. This is my wash bag. Look at this. I just can't even. This is so cute. I found it among my stuff. I totally forgot that I had this. Um, they used to do um I think a Montreal and they had this Magical Express bus. So, I'm gonna use this to put all my toiletries in for this upcoming trip. This was from um Disney Springs so many years ago now. I want to say I got this in maybe like 2013 or something like that. Absolutely love that. Um how does Mia Connect work for return back to the airport on the last day? So, they'll send you a text and an email and let you know your pickup time. It's usually I think they actually send you that the day before as a reminder. It's normally about 4 hours before and um they will pick you up from there. There's always like one place that they pick you up from so you can just ask where that is and um then you have to go back home which is really really sad and upsetting. Um but yeah, they do it's a good service. It does get you there pretty quick especially going back. Um I find that it's it's pretty speedy to get you there. Uh, best doughnut recommendation from Voodoo Donuts. Um, I really like the orange creamsicle. And um, whatever that one was I had last time, the maple, if you go back and watch my vlog, the last day or no, the day we did Universal Studios that day. Um, we went to Voodoo Donut and whatever that maple thing was was incredible that I had I just can't remember the name of it now. It had like a mustache like a little guy like the Pringle guy on there. I miss Illuminations. Me too, Amy. I loved Illuminations. Um, any plans for another Disney cruise? Duncan's asking, \"Yes, I would love to do another Disney cruise.\" Paul is terrified of cruises. Um, he's just seen too many Tik Toks of horrible like scary cruise disasters and tables like flying across the room and stuff. So, he's a little bit nervous, but I do want to do a cruise and I think he would absolutely love it and totally change his mind about it, but he is a bit nervous. So, probably next year we're going to try and do that. I would love to do it again. It's one of the best things. I can't believe I went so many years without doing one. It's so good. Amazing. Yeah, that wash bag is pretty incredible. Especially now, I feel like this is a a kind of um antique thing that you can probably I don't know, maybe you could get one on eBay. I don't know if anyone's got one they're selling, but I'm definitely never going to get rid of this now. I just wish they would bring the Magical Express back to be honest. Um DFB guy posted a video about the hotel guest um either Friday or yesterday. Oh no. I mean they're normally pretty up there with their news. So I maybe it is true. That would be a real shame. I know they have the extra hours for deluxe resort guests, but the extra hours like the extra magic hours always used to be for everybody. I do feel like they're just getting rid of all the the perks. It's um it's sad really. You want to have some perks obviously. Um do you want to visit Disneyland during the 70th anniversary celebration? I would love to. It looks absolutely amazing and I do want to go back to California. Um but we do really want to do Tokyo and I've been to California more recently than I've done Tokyo. And because my brother lives in South Korea, it would be good to do a trip to visit him and then go across to Tokyo because it's only like a 2-hour plane ride. So, I think I'll probably do Tokyo again before I do California again. But definitely, I want to go back because we just didn't have enough time in the parks because I went for D23, which was incredible. Um, but it meant that we didn't have as much time in the parks. Um, thank you, Gina. Yes, we are loving it here. Absolutely amazing. I mean, we're starting to get everything up together now. We had to buy a lot of new stuff for the new place and we're just getting all our decor kind of stuff done now as well. If you had to choose one cookie from Gideonss, which one would it be? Um, my favorite is the what is it called? The pistachio. The toffee pistachio. That one is the absolutely best in my opinion. I absolutely love it. Um, instead of early entry at Disneyland, they're doing a new Lightning Lane perk. Oh, okay. That's interesting. I'll be I'll do some research into that to see what that is. Uh, the perk is one lightning lane for normal rides per person per stay. Oh, okay. So, instead of early entry, you can get a Lightning Lane. Do you have to like pre-book it or I mean, either way, realistically, in half an hour, you could probably get one attraction done. So, if they're going to give you a Lightning Lane, I I kind of get that. I think that's at least, you know, that's something. They're not just getting rid of it and not giving anything. Um, but for Disney World, if they did the same thing, I'd rather have the half an hour personally, but um, yeah, I don't know. I think people would have different I just wish wish they would go back to three fastpasses for everybody, start calling them fastpasses again. back in the day where if you had a park ticket, you could book your three. That was so good. And you just knew that you could do at least those three attractions. So, I wish they would bring that back. That would be so good. Um Elaine, yes, I'll be going back to Disneyland Paris. I mentioned that earlier in the stream. Um but it'll be next year. I was supposed to go this summer, but things just went crazy in terms of being busy and moving into this new place. So, it's going to have to be next year, probably in March, hopefully. Um, I think anything exciting will be announced at D23 this year. I don't know. Sometimes they do have like a sneaky something that we don't know about. I think a lot of things though that are coming up have been announced. So, the whole new area in Animal Kingdom, then the whole Beyond Big Thunder Mountain and all the big stuff, um, Piston Peak that's going in the Magic Kingdom. So, I don't know. I'm not sure if they're going to have anything else massive, but you never know. Never know what they might have up their sleeve. Uh, the early park hours is just for Disneyland. Nothing's been said about Disney World. Oh, okay. So, sorry. I thought someone said that that was maybe happening at Disney World, the half an hour. Okay. Right. Okay. It's Disneyland. I mean, maybe they'll um do it for both. I don't know. But um sorry I'm just reading these comments. It's hard for me to read them all. Um when will you be telling us who you're traveling with the next trip? Probably when I arrive and meet them at the airport. So I won't wait until the vlogs, but I'll probably um let you know on Instagram. Uh does anyone else still just say Fastpass? Anyway, I do that all the time. I barely refer to it as Genie or Lightning Lane. I still call it Fastpass. And I was talking to someone the other day. I remember when Hollywood Studios, there was no Toy Story Land. There was no Galaxy's Edge. Um, Toy Story Mania had just been built and it was only one. They only had like the one track on the one side. And I remember when you used to get in during park opening and everyone would just run to get a Fastpass out the machine, like a paper fastpass. I remember doing that. It was just madness. Um, are you excited for Universal UK? I'm really interested to see what it's going to be like. I have heard that they don't have the license in the UK for the Harry Potter stuff. So, these days it's weird for me to imagine Universal without Harry Potter, although it used to be like that. When I go now, I just love the Harry Potter stuff so much. So, be really interesting to see what they do have. Peter's asking, \"Would you ever do Alani?\" Yes, I definitely would. I would love to do that. Um, do you think they would ever open a fifth park at Disney World? Eventually, I think they will. Um, but I think it will be a while. Um, when you think about I started going in 2002 and I think the newest park at that point was probably Islands of Adventure cuz Animal Kingdom was 1998. So, I think it was probably Islands Adventure was the newest. and Epic that we've just got is the first big new, you know, whole new park that we've had in Universal in Disney in 23 years. So, I don't think it will happen quickly, but I think they will have a fifth one. They've definitely got the space for it. Um, Heather is saying, \"Do you think they'll ever Oh, sorry, that was the one I just read.\" Um, hoping for a new nighttime show at Animal Kingdom. The lake has sat idle for years now. Yeah, they definitely need something um in that space because it's such a huge space and they've got all that seating around the edge. I really loved Rivers of Light. Um the music I thought was great. I really enjoyed it. Obviously, they can't have fireworks or anything that would be alarming to the animals. Um but there's definitely stuff that they could do there and I'm really surprised that they haven't, especially with now a lot of the park um the Dino Land area is kind of closed. I would have thought that they would think about doing something maybe to bring people into that park for the evening, but they're closing so early. When I was there in May, um they were closing at like 6:00 p.m. So, um you couldn't even see Pandora in the dark. So, at the moment, I think they're just not seeing that park at all as like a nighttime park. But hopefully at some point, um it will do. Um new new Zootopia show starts in November. Yes, we will actually be there for opening day of that show. Um, which is really cool. So, I'm looking forward to that. Um, yeah, loved Rivers. Me, too. It's so good. Uh, Bev has got tickets for Mickey's very merry Christmas party. Are there any mustd do things that you'd recommend? The main things at the Christmas party is the parade and the fireworks. I would always do the second parade if you can because a lot of people will have left. So you have one parade, then you have the fireworks and some people will leave then and it clears out quite a bit and then you have the second parade. So I would always do fireworks and second parade. Definitely make sure you do that. Um, and in the early part of the evening, I would prioritize doing any character meet and greets that you want to do. If there's one that you really, really want to do, they do get quite long lines. So, last time I did the Halloween party, I queued to meet the Winnie the Pooh characters, and I queued up before the party started. I think I queued at like six. Um, and then as soon as the party kind of began at 7, it was quite quick then, um, that I got to actually meet the characters. So, character meet and greets I would do earlier in the day. Um, Ke's got the chance for Mickey's Halloween party this year. Should we do it? Um, we're not doing Disney this year. It's actually a really good um way to get a little bit of Disney without buying a main park ticket. I believe you can get in from 400 p.m. So, the party starts at 7. So, actually, if you think about it, you do get quite a decent amount of time in the park. So, it can be a good way to get a bit of park time and do the party. The tickets aren't cheap, but they are cheaper than the Christmas party. The Christmas party tickets are so expensive. I was a bit shocked actually when I was looking this year. I was like, \"Wow, that's crazy.\" On that note, I found this talking about looking through and finding old stuff. This is more of a non-D Disney offsite thing. I found a menu from Tony Rom. I know what year this is from. What I thought I would do is tell you guys a couple of the prices and you can tell me what year you think this menu is from. cuz I found it among my old stuff and I was like, \"Wow, this is crazy.\" So, let me just tell you here and you tell me what year you think this was just cuz everything has gone up in price to a scary degree. So, let me just pick out something. So, we've got a a 9 oz sirloin steak is $1549. And we've got a burger. A blue cheeseburger is $7.99. So tell me what year you think this is from cuz I do know. I do remember when I got this. And let's see what else is on. Oh my god, this is so crazy looking at the prices. Yeah, I do. I remember picking this up. Okay, we got some guesses. Um Joe went to Tony Romans for my 20th. That was 28 years ago. I loved Tony Rovers. It was one of my favorite um international drive places to go. Um Bonnie saying, \"I heard there isn't going to be a Disney experiences panel at D23.\" Yeah, I heard that as well, actually. So maybe they just kind of haven't got as much stuff, so they're not doing a whole to announce. So they're not doing a whole planner planner panel. God, I can't get my words out. Um so we got Let's see some of these guesses. 2005, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2008, 1998, 2005. Um, late '9s to early 2000s, 2011, 2003, 2000. Um, I love Tony Romas and Ponderosa on ID Drive when I visited in the '9s. Yeah, Tony Rom um was definitely one of my favorite places. Used to go to Chili's quite a lot. They used to do endless ribs as well. Not that I eat ribs, but that was a big thing that Tony Romans did. Johnny Rockets. Yes, that my first two trips I went to Johnny Rockets loads of times and used to go to the cinema there as well. The onion loaf. I know the onion loaf was it's a bit like a blooming onion, but it was just I loved it. It was amazing. I just let everybody else guess and then I'll tell you what year it was. Um, have I done the Keys to the Kingdom tour? The Dun family is asking. Yes, I have. I did it a long time ago, so it would have been 2013, I want to say. So, it was quite a long time ago. Um, absolutely loved it, though. I don't I would imagine it's changed a tiny bit, but not too much. And it was so worth it. Really great. We got to go um backstage behind the um like Haunted Mansion. We got to go down to the util doors. I don't know if they still let you do that, but that was really great. Um Johnny Rockets is on my Royal Caribbean cruise. Is it? Oh, that's amazing. Is there still one at inter like on International Drive at Point Orlando? Is that still there? And does anyone remember the Fyo Schwarz store? Like the massive It had like a big ragd doll outside and a giant Barbie shoe. Um I used to stay in the Rosen Plaza that was opposite. Gosh, that is such a long time ago. That's crazy. Um was I able to go to Wet N Wild Water Park on International Drive back in the day? Yes, I did. I remember Wet N Wild. Um, so let me tell you about this. Somebody did get it right, but I think it was only one person got it dead on. I know a couple of people got it dead on. 2008 is the year of this menu. I could not believe I still had it. I was just looking among my things and I was like, \"Wow, that is definitely an old one. $7.99 for your burger. That'd be good, wouldn't it, if it was still that much.\" So, yeah, I found that. And I also had one of my favorite photos that I've taken at Disney. I showed this in my vlog over on Victoria in Detail. I've had this one made into a print. So, this is an unfiltered photo that I took at Saratoga Springs last year. Such good lighting that day. I'm not amazing photographer, but it just happened to uh um come in. Amy buzzing. I got that bag on. I I knew you'd be so happy, Amy. When I saw you said 2008, I was like, \"Yep, you got it. Got it right.\" Um, do you prefer Denny's or IHOP? I prefer IHOP, but they're both I I do like both for breakfast especially. Um, so yeah, 2008 and I remember 2004 or was it five? I went to Chili's a lot like I saying that year. And where was the other place I used to go that's now gone? Does anyone remember Race Rock? I used to go there. That was really close to Point Orlando. And which was the other one? There was one other place I used to go to loads. Tony Romans definitely was one of them. Seems like forever ago when I think about going to those places and staying on International Drive. Um, yeah, that seems like so long ago now. Crazy. Um, Jose is saying, \"If you could name a new Disney ship, what would you name it?\" Oh, that's a I'm going to have to think about that one. That is a good question. Hm. Give me a minute to think on that. Uh, we did Keys to the Kingdom last September. April is saying, um, yes, you do still go down to the utilsors. That's cool. I love doing that. And I just thought it was really nice. Like, it was a very good tour. It wasn't too long, but it wasn't short either. You felt like it was worth the money. And there is another one, isn't there? What's the other one called that's shorter? Oh, it's gone out of my head. There is another one that I was meaning to do. Then COVID happened. Uh, Magic Kingdom, Marceline to Magic Kingdom. I think that's it. I think that's what it's called. Um, I don't know if they're still doing that actually, that tour. Maybe I should look into it. I know they stopped all of them over co and the other one I did which I really loved was the World Showcase tour. And you start that earlier in the morning before World Show showcases open. So, we saw the Mexico pavilion completely empty. Um, and several of the others as well. I loved doing that tour. That was really good. And there was only three of us on the tour, so it was almost like a private tour. Um, I remember the Gladiators dinner show in the on the 192. Yeah, dinner shows were such a big thing, weren't they? The um what was the other one called? The What was it called? The other dinner show that it I'm trying to think how to describe it. It was like um it had like nights and like jousting and stuff. I don't know. I'm totally like trying to remember back to the early 2000s now. Is that the one you mean? Maybe that's the one you're talking about as well. I definitely remember that was a really popular thing for people who were going to Florida at that uh point in time. I was thinking the other day though about the parks when I first started going and like like I was saying with Hollywood Studios there at first there was no Toy Story even and no like I say no Galaxy's Edge and I kind of think to myself like it must have been shorter like shorter days in the parks cuz it wouldn't have taken you very long to to do everything in that park. Magic Kingdom would have still probably been mostly the same but yeah it's changed a lot. or Philip has suggested Disney Discovery. That would be good actually for a new cruise ship. Um, have I done the fireworks cruise? No, I haven't. I do know quite a few people who have done them because you've got the Magic Kingdom ones. Then you've got ones that you can do for the Epcot fireworks like under the bridge there. Loads of people have said they really enjoyed them and they've been really worthwhile. At one point, again, unless I'm I've completely invented this, they used to do a a fireworks cruise on the big um feries that take you to and fro from the parking lot. Have I just invented that? I'm sure at one point that was a thing. Sometimes I wonder whether I've just imagined something, but I'm sure that was a thing at some point. Um, can you book a stay at Saratoga Springs without using vacation club? Yes, you can. You can stay there um just paying out of pocket. if it's available when you do a search it should come up. It's kind of um a little bit more expensive than the cheapest deluxe. So, usually the cheapest deluxe is Animal Kingdom normally and then Wilderness Lodge is kind of around there. Then you have like Saratoga Springs and Old Key West. So, price-wise it's that's kind of where it sits usually. Took my daughter when it was MGM. Yeah, I remember it being I still call it MGM sometimes. That does sometimes um just come out of my mouth still. MGM. Um do you feel the UK pavilion in the World Showcase is under represented in vlogs? It probably is a little bit actually. Um I was thinking about this the other day when I was planning my dining reservations and I've just done a podcast for Patreon actually talking about how I decide on what dining reservations to do. And um I talk about this a little bit in in that podcast, but with the I feel like the restaurant in the Rosen Crown, they literally have now three entre on the menu. That's it. I think it's fish and chips, shepherd's pie, and there's one other thing. So when I've looked at it, cuz I try and do all the different restaurants in the vlogs, and I try and kind of mix it up and do new ones if and some old favorites, but I do try and do them. But when I looked at the menu, I was like, I literally just wouldn't want to eat any of that. And there's so think there's one on one appetizer, which is a scotch egg, three options, and like two desserts. That is it on the menu. And it's not like one of those set things. It's that's just the whole menu. So, I think that's a bit weird. I feel like they could definitely do more with the restaurant. I know they probably have done that because those are the most popular items, but I don't know. I just don't even like the menu there. So, that's why I haven't covered that. And I do think that they could do something. The gardens that are kind of out the back. So, when you go through the gap where the shops are, there's like that big bit of garden area. Um, I feel like that's quite large there. And I think what they should do is open a tea room. They need to open like a traditional English tea room where you can get an afternoon tea. um your scone or scone and jam and that whole thing. Like they should totally do that. That's so British. I feel like they could, you know, do something with that and that would be another option of somewhere to eat there because like I say, the Rosen Crown restaurant, I just I haven't even gone because it's just so um limited on the menu and I just wouldn't like it. So, I do think they could do a little bit more. It's quite a big area um that pavilion. So, they definitely need something. Obviously, there was going to be some sort of walkthrough attraction, the Cherry Tree Lane attraction they announced just before COVID and then it's never been heard of again. I think when CO hit, so many things just kind of disappeared off the agenda and have never resurfaced. So, I don't know whether that will ever come back on uh the agenda. Melanie saying, \"Love biscuit brew.\" Oh, me too. It's amazing. This is actually iced coffee. I've been obsessed with iced coffee recently. This is the new um Nest Cafe concentrate, the espresso concentrate with caramel. Honestly, it's amazing. I drink so much of it. Three entre. Yeah, I know. It's I think it's it used to be at least five. Um but now I think it is just three. And they maybe have something vegan as well, but it's it's just such a tiny menu. They've just been gradually like chipping away and that's all there is now. Uh we said afternoon tea would be great especially um with the love music area. They definitely should do uh like a afternoon tea. That'd be so good. Yeah, the the tea at Grand Fian is used to be in that lounge. Um the sort of the little garden room that's at the end there. Um but it's never open. I assume they've just got rid of that now. Um so that was a shame as well. Um what happened to the drone show at Disney Springs? Was that a one time only? Yeah, that that just um disappear. Yeah, live music. Sorry. Yeah, I knew that was what you meant where they have the band. Um yeah, the drone show. It kind of happened and I thought it was something that was going to be regular, but it's just kind of lowkey disappeared. And I don't know, maybe it was only supposed to be temporary, but a lot of the other resorts throughout the world, I know Hong Kong have got a drone show now, Disneyland Paris does. And um that would have been so good at Disney Springs over the the water there. So I don't know, maybe it didn't end up being any good or they found it difficult to actually produce the show each time. I don't know. I never really heard anything about it. It just kind of didn't happen again. Um is there anything special going on in Disney during June? So June you would, I think, still have Flower and Garden Festival if I'm correct because Flower and Garden Festival does go quite long. So I think you'd have that in Epcot. There are less I would say slightly less things in the summer in the way of like special events. So as you get into the fall and winter, you of course have Halloween and then Christmas. Um the the beginning of the year can be somewhat like that as well. Festival of the Arts though is amazing in Epcot. But yeah, I think you still have um Flower and Garden Festival at least for some of the month. Oh, it was a summer offering never meant to be permanent. There we go. I actually didn't know. I did see it and it looked really good, but it's a shame cuz that would be quite good. It'd be so good to have a drone show in one of the parks though. I wish they would do that because it looks amazing at Disneyland Paris. Um the drone shows that they have there. I really wish they would have something like that at Disney World. would be good. Right, how long have we been going? We've been going nearly an hour. Oh my gosh. If anybody does have any questions, by the way, please do ask them. Um, and also just let me know because it's really rapidly approaching when I'm doing this trip. Is there anything specific that you want to see in the vlogs? So, in terms of new things, like I say, we're going to Beacon Barrel, we're going to Gio 82, we're going to the Cake Bake restaurant on the boardwalk. We'll be doing both the new shows in Hollywood Studios. Um, Test Track we're going to be doing. Um, but let me know if there's anything specific, any resorts that you'd really like us to see because we will be going and doing a bit of resort hopping. So, is there any that you want us to show? Any snacks? Please do let me know because I do always want to cover what you guys want to see. So, let me know and I can write those down. And yeah, it's I'm just so excited. I cannot wait for um this trip, but also going during the Christmas season with Paul. Paul absolutely loved going to Disney and doing the parks. He will be on a future live stream with me. He couldn't do this one, but he will um do a live stream next time. He just he just loved it. Absolutely loved everything. So, can't wait to go back. Um I wish I could drink coffee this late. I wouldn't sleep. It doesn't affect me in the slightest. I could drink coffee 10 minutes before going to bed and it just doesn't keep me awake. But it makes me feel awake in the morning. It's clearly a placebo situation, but oh well. I don't mind if it's placebo. I'm happy. I'm expecting to need a third case to come home. Should I book it now or wait and see if I need it? I would probably wait and see if you need it. Um I always in the past when I've needed an extra suitcase, I've gone to Walmart and bought one of those fold up. It's like a massive hold with wheels on it, but it folds down just to a little square. Um, but when it's folded out, it's pretty much the size of a suitcase. And then you can just add it on. But add it on before you go to the airport cuz it can be more expensive in the moment when you get there. But if you go online, you can add an extra one if you need to. Uh, what's it like for allergies at Disney resorts and restaurants? Orlando restaurants. Disney is amazing with anything like that. any allergies or dietary requirements, they're very, very good with that. They're very careful as well. So, if you do have severe allergies, the chef will always come out and discuss those with you. So, Disney's great for stuff like that. Excuse me, I just I didn't realize at the bottom and I just made a straw slurping noise. That's gross. Have you seen the cookies and cream beignes? Yes, the Haunted Mansion Beignetes. I think we're going to have to get those. uh the new shows at Hollywood Studios. There is the new villains show and there's also the new Little Mermaid show. So, we're going to do both of those. I don't know whether or not I'll be able to film them though. Some you can, some you can't. So, we'll definitely do them though and let you know what they're like. Tanya is saying, \"Can I send you a Target Publix shopping list?\" Yeah, I mean there's always so many things that I need to buy as well um when I'm in the in the States. I've got a list on the go already. Um, are we going to the Halloween party? Yes, we are. Um, Janette will be doing that. Can't wait to do that. I love the Halloween parade so much. And, um, it's just always such a highlight for me, the Headless Horseman. And on the one thing I do want to see this year though, just going forward to the next trip when we do the Christmas party. Last time I did the Christmas party, the toy soldiers weren't in it. I don't know why. I tried to get to the the bottom of it and I couldn't, but the toy soldiers are my favorite part and they just weren't in the parade. So, this year I'm really hoping I don't miss out on that. Um, can I do a shopping vlog um like Walmart or other shops we don't have for seasonal merch? Yes, I will do that when we go because we always go to a supermarket at least once. I will do a video on that and show you all the Halloween stuff because in the States, you guys, whoever's watching from the States, you have so much better Halloween stuff. In the UK, it's getting we get a lot more Halloween stuff than we ever used to, but it's still nothing like what you guys get in the States. So, it's always fascinating to um see that. Uh Kefir is saying, \"How is Universal with a sunflower lanyard?\" I don't know actually, but if anybody else who's um on the live stream, if anybody else knows um then hopefully they could let you know because I honestly haven't got any experience with that. I would imagine they're good with those sorts of things, but I I don't know honestly is the answer. So, if anybody else knows and if they have one, they can perhaps let you know um what they're like. Uh would I ever do Halloween Horror Nights? Yes, I'm going to get um Paul to do that with me next year. Um because this year when we go in November, Halloween Horror Nights will have finished. Um, but I think Paul will absolutely love it and I'll be terrified whenever I do it. I need to eventually do it. So, I thought it'd be best for me and him to do that together. Um, but yeah, it will be scary. Definitely scary. Um, I wonder if Tally the Elf will be back at the Christmas party this year. Why do I not know who that is? Is that in the show? cuz I didn't do the Christmas party last year. So that might be something that I've missed because yeah, I wasn't in the No, I didn't do last year in the Christmas season. So maybe that was something from last year. Um I think the cost of the Esther is increasing next year. Oh, it might be. I think it's gone up slightly over the years. Um not by much, but a little bit. I can't remember. I just redid mine actually and I can't remember what it was. Um, Tally was in the parade went mega viral on Tik Tok. Oh, okay. Was that last year? Because I I would have totally maybe missed that because I didn't do the Christmas season. I don't remember that from the one before. So, I don't know. Maybe it was just a new thing next last year, but hopefully we'll get to see it this year if they're back again. Anything that went viral on Tik Tok, I reckon they'll probably bring back. Um, if Disney would add another country to the World Showcase, which country should be added? This is always a tough one. There's so many that I think would be good. There's so many that would be good. I'd really love to see Spain. I think that would be good. And I think Australia would be good, too. Let me know. What do you guys think? Where would you add? I think those I I would love to see Spain. I think that would be good. And I do feel like they probably have got space for another one where it goes from um the China pavilion, then you've got the bridge, then you kind of have the the section there before it gets to Germany. Um I do believe there was supposed to be a whole proper pavilion there. I don't know what happened or why there isn't. Egypt. Yep. There's I mean there's so many that would be would be really good, but they definitely got space there to add another one. Okay. It was 2024, so that's why I have no idea who that was cuz I missed that one. Yeah, $21. That sounds right. Yeah, it has gone up a little bit for the Esther. Um hopefully it doesn't end up going up and up and up because if you got like a whole family who everybody needs one, then it gets quite expensive. South Korea, yeah, that would be good. Egypt. Yeah, I do I do think either of those would be really good. And I have been to both of those, so it' be good to see what their take on it would be. So, I'm just reading the extra comments coming up. I feel like somebody outside my window is doing some kind of DIY. And it's actually dark. That's a weird thing to be doing at this kind of night. Time of night. Essa, due to double next year due to the World Cup. Oh my gosh. Is it? That's crazy because it's two years, isn't it? Last four. So, I've just done mine now. Did you ever try the curry chicken pockets in the joy of tea pavilion in China? They were amazing, but they took them away. No, I never tried those. That pavil that little um joy of tea stand. They have some pretty good stuff there actually. It's easily overlooked. And I think that's there year round, isn't it? It's not just a um festival thing. So, yeah, that is quite good. And I'm trying to think what other restaurants we've got. Let me just remind myself because I have got my plan here. Trying to think which other ones we're doing just so I can let you know what's to come. So obviously Gio82 I've let you know about that. We are doing Crystal Palace. This time we're doing dinner though. Um oh did I do that? Did I do dinner? I've done breakfast and dinner there at various different times. Um we're going to go to Three Bridges and actually um eat in the restaurant there because I've never done that. I've been for a drink there. And homecoming. I have got a homecoming reservation and that's a really difficult one to get. I always find. I don't know if anyone else finds that, but homecoming is really difficult to actually get. Oh, and also I wanted to let you guys know the cake bake restaurant, you know, the new one on the boardwalk, that's really difficult to get a reservation, but they also do reservations on Open Table. So, if you want to eat there and you haven't been able to get one, try Open Table because that's what I did and managed to get a reservation. So, that's worth knowing. And a lot of the Disney Springs restaurants actually do use Open Table as well. Um, unfortunately, not Homecoming. So, Homecoming just seems to be difficult to get for whatever reason. It's just really hard to get a reservation there. Um, Amy's only ever managed to get it once. Yeah, it's really, really difficult. And I've managed to get it this time. And I haven't I don't think I've shown that in the vlogs for quite a long time. So, that's good. Um, have I done Guys a Point? Yes, I have. Um, when did I do that? May last year. So, May 2024. If you go back to those vlogs, um, we did go there. It was me and Kate. Yeah, I think it was me and Kate went there in Wilderness Lodge. But I'm going to wrap this up pretty soon, I think, cuz we've been going for an hour now. So, any last little things you guys wanted to get in, please do. Um, Dina is going to Boston in two weeks. Amazing. um doing your dining reservations while you're there. That's always like really stressful when you're on on some sort of trip or you're somewhere where you've got an appointment or something and then your dining reservation window is opening cuz some of them you really do have to be there at the 60-day point. Um it was like Beacon Barrel the other night. It was at midnight that it opened um in the UK and I was like falling asleep and then I woke back up again and it put me into like a waiting room and I think it got to about 20 12 and I was thinking oh they're all going to have gone but I managed to snag one but yeah it was tricky to get. Um we've got reservations at Summerhouse. Have you been? Yes I have. I went on opening day of Summer House on the Lake because my flight got cancelled and I had an extra day. So, I managed to be there for um opening day and I love it. Absolutely love their Cobb salad was really good. Their pizzas are really nice there. Very, very good. And Katherine and I went actually in March. Um what date are you doing it? I uh it's towards the end I think. So, it'll be like 16th again. Um I think uh would you do an Alaskan cruise? I would love to do that. Um I'd also love to do a cruise and do the Norwegian fjords. That looks stunning as well. Um, Cynthia saying, \"I could not believe I was able to snag Beacon Barrel.\" Me, too. I was so happy cuz I really, really wanted to experience that. Um, Beacon Barrel, I'm sure it's right at the end of the trip. So, I want to say the 16th, I think. So, probably 16th. And Homecom, I think we're doing the 17th. That would make sense. Um, when can you make reservations if you're staying off property? So, with dining reservations, everybody can make them at 60 days out. Um, it's just if you're staying in a Disney hotel, you can make your 10 days worth at the 60-day window. So, if you got that resort reservation, you'll be able to do like 10 days, I think it's 10 days, not two weeks of your trip. If you're staying off site, you do 60 days and then each day you would have to go online to do the next one, if that makes sense. Um, any plans to go to Shanghai or Hong Kong? Yes, I would love to do that. I'd love to do all of them at some point. Definitely would love to do that. Um, cake bake shop prices, is it worth it? It is very expensive. Um, the actual bakery where you can get like the slices of cake and stuff, I think they I want to say they were $22 or something like really really pricey. I had the key lime pie that was a lot cheaper and it was abs I think that was like half the cost of the cake and it was delicious. the actual restaurant. The prices are kind of up there, but that's what we're going to do is go and experience it and let you know whether it is worth it or not. It's kind of like one of those things. It depends what you order as well. So, we're going for I think like the afternoon, so it still be the lunch menu. And yeah, we'll we'll let you know whether it's worth it or not. It is it is pricey though, I will say for for what it is. But then everything is at Disney. Everything's pricey. Um is it a solo trip? No. I do have a travel buddy this time and you'll find out who that is when I get to the airport. And then in November, Paul is coming with me again. He's so excited to be going back. Uh, where would you put a DVC lounge in Hollywood Studios in Animal Kingdom? Oo, I would. So, Hollywood Studios. That's a good question. Where would I put one in Hollywood Studios? I would have said where like Star Wars launch bay and everything's going to be, but of course that's going to be the new Monsters Inc. area. Um, I would probably put one like maybe back behind the Tower of Terror. Like imagine if there was a there was space somewhere back there where the exit is and you could have like a haunted haunted mansion, a Tower of Terror themed DVC lounge. That would be incredible. And in Animal Kingdom, imagine if you could have one in the Tree of Life, but we're going to have the new show, the the Zootopia show in there. But that that would be amazing, wouldn't it? That would be so good. Um, so yeah, I'm going to back up now um because I could just be here forever. It's been so nice chatting to you guys, though. And I will be doing a couple couple more of these. Um, potentially I'll do another one before I go away, just because I've got a couple of other videos coming up, but the vlogs will just be a few weeks before they start. Um, because I'm not going for another couple of weeks. So, I might do another one of these and get Paul to join me. So, if you've got any questions for him as well, he will be here to chat to you. Best resort to stay in with an under five, hoping to go in 2028. I would say probably Art of Animation. That'd be quite nice. But the Little Mermaid rooms, which are the only standard rooms, they are a bit of a walk. So, if not, I would say maybe Pop Century. Pop Centry is one of my favorites. I absolutely love that. Um, Janette saying bye from Sunny Florida. Goodbye everybody. And thank you so much. It's been so nice catching up with you all. Like I say, we don't do these often enough anymore, so I will try and do a few more. If you enjoyed it, give it a little thumbs up so I can see that you want more live streams. But it's always nice to chat to you. I really do appreciate you guys um for being here and I just can't wait to bring more vlogs. It won't be long now. So, just a couple of weeks and obviously follow along on Instagram because you'll see things in real time. I always put up stories and photos while I'm actually there and then of course the vlogs will be to come after that. Um so yeah, anyone who's there in September or November, please do come over and say hello if you see us. Um really enjoyed this. I did too. I really enjoyed it. So thank you all for being here. Um, I hope you have a good weekend. Well, there's not much of the weekend left, but if you're in the UK, I hope you have a nice bank holiday. Um, and for everyone else, I hope you have a good week. And now I've got to try and do the thing to actually point and and stop this this stream. So, I will see you guys soon. Bye."

      "transcript": "Some Disney splurges worth it, but others total ripoffs. Starting with this guy who is melting very quickly. Mickey bars. Yes, they're iconic and can confirm they are delicious, but also you might be able to find them at your local grocery store. The inpark markup for these is wild. That little guy I just got was $6.99. And I found an entire box of them on Amazon for $8.70. Maybe consider going for a treat that is truly exclusive to the theme parks. But let's be real for a second. We know that it is crazy expensive here. Magical, but expensive. Yes, that's why I'm sharing some of the most overpriced, overhyped, and overrated things at Disney World. And there's one here that people will definitely fight me on. But first, the merch trap. Disney merge is everywhere and I 100% get it because you want to bring a little piece of the magic home with you. But if you're looking to avoid ripoffs, save a little bit of money, look outside of the parks. Orlando is full of stores that are just minutes from Disney World that all sell Disney items. You may have heard of the Character Warehouse, which is in the outlets, which I love because it's discounted merchandise from the Disney parks, but a ton of stores here carry Disney products, things you might not think about like CVS, Target, Walmart, and a little bit of air conditioning cuz it is so hot out there. Y'all might need another hat. Anyway, Disney Springs, that could be a great place to get Disney items as well because they don't just carry Disney parks exclusive items, but a lot of the stores there like Levi Vera Bradley, they have their own unique merchandise filled with little Disney flare. But also, there are two things you might think are a ripoff, but kind of maybe aren't. Well, one of them I'm actually not entirely sure if it is possible. So, I'm going to have to test that out today. Something else is not a total ripoff, but I have a better alternative for you, and that is stroller rentals. Right now, it is $15 a day to rent a stroller, but that can add up. I never really thought about this until my brother brought his kids last summer, and we spent $60 just to rent strollers. That is cheeseburger spring rolls. So, what we're going to do is buy an inexpensive foldable stroller on Amazon. And then at the end of our trip, we're either going to take it back with us or we're going to donate it to another family. Another option is to do a third-party stroller rental. Yes, here in the Disney World area, there are stroller rental companies. Either direction, it's budget friendly, comfortable, and way less hassle. Still trying to figure out if one of my not ripoff facts is actually a thing or just like something I read on the internet. First job that had no idea what I was talking about. I legitimately don't know if this is a thing, which is why I always like to try out the hacks and tips myself so I can make sure I'm giving you the best information. Oh, that's so cute. Oh my gosh, what a fun surprise. Well, and that actually brings me to my next point. So, one example of character dining is here at Hollywood and Vine in Hollywood Studios. What's great about character dining is you get to sit down, relax, have a good meal, and meet characters without waiting in line because they come to you. Wins all around. However, a lot of people rush to book their character dining meal for the evening for dinner. You know, like a little special cap to the day. Now, this I actually learned from trips to Disney World as a kid, avoiding ripoffs since 96. That's to do character meals for breakfast. My family growing up always did breakfast at Crystal Palace where we met the Winnie and Pooh friends. Why that's great is can't mess up breakfast food. Plus, if you book a later in the day breakfast, you can almost kind of treat it like brunch and you can still take full advantage of rope dropping in the morning and knocking out some rides. And some character meals have legit good food, like at the Riviera Resort for their character breakfast. Plus, that one's in a hotel, so you don't even need a park ticket. So, if you plan a character meal for a non-p park day, now you are not paying for a ticket and you still get your Disney character fix. You go you. Now, the next common ripoff I just realized is also food related. And I did not mean to be including so many food things in this video, but hey, it's one of the best parts of a Disney vacation. So, let's talk about not all quick service meals are created equal. Some of them are still great. Looking at you, Riviera. Now, I'm totally fine with spending money at Disney World and we love Disney World, but I want to feel like the value is there. And I began noticing that some restaurants at Disney World, you could order an item from a sitown restaurant for about the same or maybe just a little bit more than going to a quick service restaurant. Although obviously commisseries grilled cheese, it was still pretty good. This isn't about necessarily just spending more. It's about getting the most out of what you spend. I'm so impressed by the cereal team who can do this water art. This is exactly what I'm talking about when I mean to slow down and just really appreciate the little moments at Disney World. That slower pace, it's all about making thoughtful choices at Disney World. And our next ripoff, usually not one of those. Preferred parking. Maybe at Magic Kingdom, maybe at Epcot when it's like a really busy day, but for the most part, preferred parking is a ripoff because my car is literally right there and now I'm standing in preferred parking. Now, about that mystery tip. In this shop back here, one of the two cast members says she thinks he's heard something about this. So, mystery still continues. When you stay at a Disney resort, you have the option to upgrade to a preferred room. And usually that means it's in a better location or closer to a pool or something like that. Now, it is more expensive to do this. And so, some people might be like, \"Yeah, totally not worth it.\" However, if you know which room to stay at, it's going to really help your Disney day. I recently stayed in a preferred room at Art of Animation and it was fantastic. It was right by the Skyliner. So, I literally walked down the hall on air conditioning, stepped outside and was at the Skyliner station. So, that was pretty sweet. but also for moderate resorts. That's where this really could come in handy because they are sprawling like Port Orleans. Knowing which rooms are and are not worth the upgraded preferred room price is really helpful. And actually, if y'all want a video on which buildings for different resorts are worth it, leave a comment down below. All right, I have one more place I can check to see if the thing that I've always thought was a ripoff may not actually be. [Music] Oh my gosh, I am so excited right now because I have never never had a Disney balloon before. And the reason was they're pricey and I was like, well, it's I can't take it back home with me on an airplane, right? So, it feels like it's just something you can enjoy while you're here at Disney World. But I just learned that if you have one of these classic Mickeyshaped balloons, you can untie the string at the bottom and then deflate the balloon, pack it with you, and then reinflate it when you get where you're going. Keep the magic alive. Now that you know some things to skip, want to know what's actually worth the splurge? Well, check out this video here. And as always, I'm Molly. I'll meet you on Main Street."

But honestly, some of them are a little bit of a waste of time and money, but I'm here to see which ones actually work. Looking for little ways to save money, like skipping lightning lanes. Sounds like a great idea until you are standing in line for Tiana's Bayou Adventure and it is 104° and there's a 65minute wait. me. We're all about saving money on this channel, but skipping Lightning Lanes to save some money might actually backfire. Now, there are some parks where really you could skip it. Animal Kingdom and Epcot looking at you. But here at Magic Kingdom and especially Hollywood Studios, hello Drain. Yes, it's going to cost you a bit of money, but the time savings you'll get 100% can make up for it if you know how to use them strategically. So, my family is coming into town soon to have our family's annual trip to Disney World. But unfortunately, this time I won't be able to spend a lot of time in the parks with them. So, I need to make sure that the advice I give them 100% works. And I'll say some of this advice, it's a little bit controversial. Do not bring your personal water bottle while that was out. Yes, it can save you money, but trust me, carrying this thing around all day by the time it gets to fireworks is going to feel real heavy. So, what I'd recommend instead is to ask for free cups of ice water when you're at a quick service location. There are even a lot of locations around Disney World that now have selfs serve water dispensers. That way, you can hydrate until your heart is content. However, one thing I do always do in the park is either bring in a disposable water bottle or I purchase one when I get here, always from a gift shop to get the annual passholder discount. It fits really easily into my park bag and I can simply toss it if I get tired of carrying it. Something I hear a lot of is to buy your souvenirs at the end of the night. I mean, totally sounds good in theory, but let's be real. By the end of the night, you're exhausted and you're not going to be rushing back to the Tron gift shop to buy that one specific circular light up thing after fireworks at 11:00 at night. Probably not happening. But on the flip side, you also don't want to buy your souvenirs at the beginning of the day because then you're going to be carrying around bags all day and you might have some regret from a rushed purchase. Take pictures or make note of the items you want and then go purchase them later. Best yet, if you are heading back to your resort for a midday rest, that's the perfect time to purchase your souvenirs. The transportation isn't as crowded. you're not trying to shove a giant lightsaber onto the Disney buses at 10:00 at night. Or if the item is available on the Shop Disney website, saves you tons of hassle. There are even some gift shops at Disney World where you can pay to have the item shipped directly to your home. Easiest of all. The next popular hack, I'll admit I've even recommended myself. But the problem is that most people don't lay out the full story. Not staying at a Disney resort and staying offsite looks good on paper a lot of times. There's longer transportation time to the parks. That is if your off-site accommodations even offer transportation to Disney World. There's no early entry perks for a lot of the off-site hotels. The best lightning lanes might be gone by the time you can book because if you're not staying at Disney World, you can only book 3 days in advance. Not even to mention parking, which currently I think when I drove in here, I saw the sign said $49. Oh, y'all, that adds up fast. But the absolute biggest thing, and oftent time the resorts don't make this really apparent, and it's those resort fees. These add-on resort fees that often aren't included in that really nice looking booking price can sometimes be almost as much as the room itself. So, when you're deciding where to stay, take everything into consideration. Room, transportation, perks, because it might just be that sometimes staying at an all-star resort here at Disney World might actually turn out to be the better deal. rope dropping or prioritizing a really popular ride at Disney World as the first ride of your Disney day is a great strategy. Although there's a little bit more nuance than just, hey, this ride is popular. Let's pick that one for rope drop, for example. I'll often see early entry advice for Epcot where people recommend getting to Rey's Ratatouille Adventure first. Now, the thing about that attraction, it's a very technical attraction, and it is notorious for shutting throughout the day and even opening late, which I actually ran into the other day when I was testing out an early entry strategy plan for my family at Epcot. You can see that the crowd just continued to swell as the early entry time passed. So, look at the full story of popular rides. In this case, I'd recommend rope dropping Frozen Ever After if you're doing early entry. That way, whether you're entering from the front of Epcot or back at the International Gateway area, you're going to have the same chance of getting to that attraction because it's in the middle of the park. You can see that not many people were roped dropping it when I went to test my strategy the other day. Also for Remy specifically, but it applies to some other Disney World attractions, it has a single rider line, so you could prioritize something else and then later in the day, if you're down with it, opt to jump into the single rider line and have a shorter wait. Everyone talks about mobile ordering your meals to save time, which really is good advice. But when you're probably looking for a meal, it's nothing worse than wanting some corn dog nuggets from Casey's and realizing that the return window is over an hour long. At peak times, that can definitely happen. And no one's got time for that on their Disney day. So instead, go ahead and order your meal in the morning. So, like if you want to mobile order lunch, have it placed by like 10:30 a.m., but don't click the I'm here until you're ready to eat. The alternative is to place your mobile order for off peak times when it's not going to be as crowded. Getting Disney gift cards as gifts throughout the year and then saving them up for your Disney trip is a great idea. Or, you know, looking to see if there's ever a deal on Disney gift cards. Awesome. great way to budget. However, the advice often stops there. All well and good until it's time to check out at the Emporium on Main Street at the end of the night and you are frantically searching through all those gift cards trying to figure out which one still has a balance on it. So, to save you some stress, go to the Disney gift card website before your trip and then combine all of those separate gift cards onto one gift card. Another tip I see is to plan, plan, plan your Disney day. Nothing wrong with that. I think it's great and you actually should have some kind of idea of what your Disney day is going to look like. But planning out every second and moment of the day is just asking for burnout, frustration, confusion when the ride breaks down or your kid breaks down and needs a nap. So instead of overplanning, plan a couple of anchor moments. You know, a show, a couple of rides, maybe a dinner reservation, and then leave space for spontaneity or flexibility because that's often when the most magical moments happen. Tips I'll hear about park strategy is to prioritize Magic Kingdom, which I mean, I get it's magical. It is so Disney. And I mean, look at her. She's beautiful. And there's lots of folks here all enjoying their magical day. But instead of prioritizing Magic Kingdom, I actually recommend doing Epcot or Animal Kingdom first. My family, we always do Animal Kingdom the first day of our Disney trip. And I think I'm going to definitely still keep with that recommendation for this year as well. I'm actually going to suggest that my family does the opposite of prioritizing Magic Kingdom and actually saves this park for their last Disney day. That way they're kind of going against the flow of maybe what other people are doing. Maybe a little less busy, but definitely a very magical way to end your Disney"

      "transcript": "epcot's flower and garden festival is back but if you don't know what's new and what's completely overrated you could waste your day and I'm not going to let that happened to you I'm giving you everything you need to know to make the most of your visit this year Disney has added brand new topiaries as well as two new food booths I'll cover all of this in just a moment but first want to talk about some of the Hidden experiences that sometimes people just walk right by there are several Global Gardens throughout the festival my lowy obsession this year and it's really easy to overlook this one is the prehistoric plant garden near Cosmic rewind this has plants that have survived since the prehistoric times but there are cute little dinosaurs hidden throughout this Garden it's just precious although if you're like okay this sounds awesome but when does the festival even start can we get a little basic Festival information I got you in just a moment also this wind is so intense it's literally making my ice water oh the Great for festival days however if you're like I know what flower and garden festival is this has been on my calendar for weeks you can go ahead and use the time stamps down below to skip to what's new this year but now for the most underrated attraction especially at flower and garden festival now I love this ride but for flower and garden festival it gets a total makeover and is filled with edible flowers Mickey topiaries and just Springtime goodness another little hidden gym and that is the tea tour over in the UK Pavilion this is where you can go around and learn about different teas how the process is made oh and it's totally free all right let's take a back now y'all if we haven't met my name is Molly and I bring you Disney tips so that you can keep creating magical Memories the Epcot International flowering garden festival runs March 5th through June 2nd and this is included as part of your Epcot admission that makes this one of the best uses of money at Disney world because you get tons of Festival exclusive extras in addition to everything else here at Epcot the festival features gorgeous topiaries and Gardens throughout the whole park there is the butterfly Landing Garden which is especially incredible because you are surrounded by butterflies there's also the garden Rocks concert series every night where you can see a different musical act throughout the festival oh and of course can't forget that there are tons of Springtime inspired food options with many many delicious food boots throughout the festival we'll talk more about that in a little bit one of the highlights of the festival and I don't know how it's even possible but Disney has outdone itself again this year because the topiaries are incredible Moana Maui poo and HEI HEI are making their debut at the festival for the first time ever can you believe that Disney always puts the largest and most prominent topiary at the front of the party and it's usually inspired by a recently released movie and Moana 2 Moana gets the spot of Honor this year and kto held that spot in years past and that topiary has returned at the entrance of World Showcase but it also a sporting a lighting feature and that's one of the cool things about this Festival this year is that a lot of the topiaries are getting enhanced lighting that allows them to be enjoyed in a different way at night like we have Asha and her star Mirabel and her Firefly maybe and Goofy and his light up dandelions over in Norway Anna and Elsa have returned but this year Elsa is sporting a lovely blue snowflake cape then there's Baby Groot or well maybe teenager Groot but his topiary debuted last year for the festival and it was over by Guardians Cosmic rewind this year however he is getting a more prominent Place catch him hanging out over in World Discovery and do not miss out on the Hidden Mickey that he's got going on and for the first time in8 years they've returned and maybe because they're getting a new season on Disney plus this summer which I am totally here for joy and friends are getting a garden here in the world celebration area along with the new play along I got to check my notes on this one hold on play along Bay play Garden that's mouthful it's a new Garden located over in the rosewalk area on your way to worldy Showcase kind of near imagination but that's not the only thing that's new in this area because if you are here for the food which first off you're my kind of Disney fan because same there are two new food booths this year and they're both located over there as well there is the yacht grub and Beach grub get it get it nice H yach grub is serving up elevated seafood and Beach grub has fresh Coastal flavors along with street corn which is one of the items on the garden Grays the name of these food boots and actually the play Garden as well is a take on the yacht and Beach Club resorts that are just outside of Epcot and there's one thing about my Audi it's that she loves a good pun so I am delighted by this kind of looks like this flower is looking at communic cor Hall it very well maybe because with the two new food boots over in the Rose area that means that Florida fresh as well as epcot's farmer Feast have moved into communicore Hall this year which is also home to a new interactive Gallery all about how the Disney fora culture team brings this incredible Festival to life like did you know that the way they keep these stunning living sculptures the topiaries alive for the entire Festival run even with the harsh Florida sun is because they build in an irrigation system inside of the toi are and speaking of incredible topiaries figment mascot of Epcot back where he was last year in the very center of the world celebration area and if You' noticed the little 30 on the topiaries over there on their little mouse ears that's a nod to this festival's history because it is the 30th anniversary of flower and garden festival happy birthday back in 1994 this Festival started with what was supposed to just be a oneoff occasion but it was so popular that here we are today one thing I love about Disney are all those little details like that for example every part of this topiary is intentional and the flowers down at the bottom are meant to reflect the African Sunset which mirrors the movie's iconic visuals while over in Norway the Frozen topiaries are surrounded by blue white and purple flowers that reflect the cool wintery tones of that film one other detail I absolutely love and I say this every chance I get so you may have heard me mention this before but it's the miniature train that's over in Germany Disney makes tiny little banners for that Village that are the exact same design as the large banners that are all around the park another little detail that I learned recently is that Spike the bee who has a prominent place at this Festival is actually a Disney character from the 1940s he originally appeared in classic cartoons with Donald and Pluto now now he's part of the fan favorite spikes poit Nation scavenger hunt how this works is that you go around and look for a spike hidden in different locations around the festival footprint then once you find him you put the sticker that matches on your map once your map is completely filled up you can redeem it for a fun prize but if you're doing the scavenger hunt and there is a prize that you really want make sure to grab the prize before you begin your scavenger hunt that way if there's a prize you really want you make sure to get it before it sells out because that does happen or for some reason you aren't able to complete the Redemption map you still will at least have your prize you can pick up a scavenger hunt map at different gift shops throughout the park including the creation shop the world traveler shop but my favorite under the radar location to get a map is Gateway gifts which is right at the entrance of the park and if you're here around Easter there is a limited time scavenger hunt called the Extravaganza extravagance get it Easter you know and what you're going to be doing is instead of looking for spikes around the festival you'll be looking for character themed Easter eggs but let's get real for a second because the food at flower and Garen Festival legendary status did you know that Disney will literally reward you for eating there's a list of eligible treats that are part of this year's Garden grades you go around and collect at least five of those treats you get the stamp in your Festival passport booklet and then then once you have gotten five treats you can come here to the pineapple prominade to get your surprise completer treat which is usually a fun souvenir with a tasty exclusive ad whip Flavor now a misconception I sometimes see about the garden grades is that you have to get five unique items that's not the case as long as you have five items purchased from the list you are good to go you can mix and match get five of the exact same thing because hey you're on vacation why not there are 10 items this year that are part of the garden graze and here are the ones that I say are actually worth it number one the avocado toast over at brunch cot now this is a festival favorite it's been here for several festivals in a row and I have gotten it for all of those festivals now the value of this treat has fluctuated with time I'll be honest but it's still a pretty solid bet second wreck is the grilled street corn over at beach grub but Molly this is a new food Booth how are you going to recommend this food glad you asked so a couple years ago they had street corn on the menu and had this incredible season topping that I still think about and so while I don't know that this is the exact same thing I have a hunch that is probably similar and if that's the case it's delicious we've got over in The Odyssey the Citrus Blossom food Booth this is where you can find the lemon tart third on my list number four again is a new treat this year and it's the coconut chocolate flan coacho in La ale fresa which is over near Morocco it's similar to treats that I've had in the past so that's why I feel pretty confident recommending it then if you're looking for something a little Savory the potato pancakes with applesauce are a classic it's the day of the festival yay I got a free uncrustable which I've been in such a peanut butter and jelly mood lately I don't know what that's all about but I have been loving them lately so this is a very nice surprise but let's talk about some potential food mistakes at the festival for when you don't get free things so you're not wasting your money we'll get into more Foods worth your time and money in just a moment because there are hundreds of Festival offerings this year don't think that just because something is new for the Festival this year you should forgo one of the classics or something you're really looking forward to in order to try the new thing now this is a big one for planning your overall Epcot day and I'm all about helping you strategize your Disney day so it's important to remember that if you're at Epcot and attending the festival the food booths don't open until 11:00 a.m. that means you can spend your morning doing other Epcot attractions and then focus on the festival after 11: this is one that I see people fall prayed to I've been there myself even and that is not realizing that there are food boots outside of World Showcase some of them you can see along the periphery but there's even some like brunch cop back here by testr that are nowhere near World Showcase and they can have some really tasty dishes and if you miss out out on them could be missing out on one of your new favorites want a real shot I love it hi and if there's something else about me it's I'm always going to get a monreal shot all right fourth food mistake as sometimes see not having a game plan now you don't have to completely plan out your entire day but there are over 170 food and drink options at the Festival this year that's a lot so at least look at the menus ahead of time if you can and have some idea of what foods you want to prioritize it is really easy to spend a lot of money at this Festival I may or may not know from personal experience so I'm here to tell you that it's good to have some idea of what budget you want to have before you arrive at the festival and then using the cute Festival themed Disney gift cards to help you stay on track while as wi to help you plan which food items you want to conquer in advance the Disney parks Blog has an entire list of every single menu for every booth at the fesal estival if you're here at Epcot you can grab a festival passport and that will have everything listed as well so you can make a little impromptu Plan before you start making your way around also the My Disney Experience app will have not only a list of all the food items but also the location of the booth I'm not sure if the Uncrustables are just a first day of the festival thing but no harm in looking if you are curious to check it out yourself they are right there I have some more tips on how to make this Festival the best day ever but since it is Festival day and everything's open let's Circle back and take a look at the floating gardens that are in the water are actually designed with a mesh underneath so they can absorb the water and stay hydrated throughout also learned that topiaries have been a part of the Disney park since 196 3 so I think that that's why I especially love that this Festival celebrates the incredible beauty of the landscaping and theming that comes from the horiculture team a flower and garden festival isn't just about the incredible topiaries and beautiful gardens it's also a Foodies paradise flower and garden festival really leans into fresh bright flavors this year there are over 47 new food items at the festival now while some food booths are a definite can Miss some might not be worth the long lines so here are the top 10 treats you must try at the festival some are a mix of things I personally like some are popular fan favorites and some are a couple of new items I think we should give a shot to these are in no particular order but starting over in Florida fresh is the Cubano which debuted last year and is delicious also in the same area we have the warm corn cookie in the farmers Feast which is only here for a limited time nearby are the chicken and waffles over at the honey beer which I've never tried but continuously hear good things about the pineapple prominade right back here also has the iconic Violet lemonade oh and when I was over there taking a look also noticed that the Redemption prize for the garden graze this year is a packet of seeds and a pineapple plant-based Vanilla swirl for the doll whip flavor I don't know if that's going to hold throughout the entire Festival but it kind of sounds like a normal dollet to me but hey cute little friese with it also Japan is a consistent winner no matter what the festival is for FL Garden you can't go wrong with the FI and the ramen cup while over in France cheese plus garlic equals winter every time and that's with the Quant de Chev the car cake leash waffles in connections eery sounds interesting but a returning favorite of mine is the Barbacoa tostada over in Mexico and then for this one I was on the fence whether I should include this or not but I know it's really popular and I might just be holding a little bit of nostalgia for its predecessor and that is the liquid nitrogen honey cheesecake however there is one potentially divisive Trend this year at the festival and that is lavender now like any good Millennial I've had my share of lavender vanilla lattes but there are some interesting takes on it this year including the provant poutine over in refreshment P which has fresh lavender on it what's your take on this is it a miss or a must now that we've talked about some of the best Festival bites let's talk about everything else flower garden has to offer with dozens and dozens of topiaries where you even start Moana and friends which are new and over at the front of the park figment icon in World celebration cute little pandas in China Mick and friends on the pathway to World Showcase with their new flying a kite scene in the Encanto family and I figured out marel is holding a butterfly but B goofy over in the Rose Walk I especially like because last year as a vessel went on they added more dandelion so be curious to see if that happens this year it was a very cute little touch Lion King Simba and friends over in World nature Tiana in America the Beautiful Beauty and the Beast over in France and the sheep from The Toy Story topiary near imagination just the Sheep especially that guy another thing you absolutely cannot miss are the vesal exclusive shows on spaceship earth during beacons of magic which starts around Sundown and because I want this to be your absolutely go-to guide for everything flower and garden 2025 that kind of rhymed um also want to mention that there are special magic shots for this Festival through photo pass like this cute little figment one there's also special merchandise this year and a lot of it has the 30th Anniversary logo on it woo I know we've covered a lot so let's take a Scenic break [Music] which is understandable because there is a lot to this Festival but there's some common mistakes I sometimes see people make but not you because you're watching this video and we're going to make sure you don't waste a single Springtime second not using the Disney Dining Plan to maximize your Festival experience you can actually use your Dining Plan snack credits at certain Festival locations missing out on an awesome treat because you didn't realize that menu changes throughout the festival certain booths like the farmers Feast actually have three different menus depending on when you are attending the festival and of keeping up with menu changes wasn't enough there are over 70 topiaries 25 Gardens and 25 food booths that's a lot to keep track of so make sure to grab a festival passport you can get at the front entrances of the parks and throughout that's going to have all of your Festival information times guides Booth locations Booth menus everything you're going to want to know but like I mentioned earlier you can also get this information on the My Disney Experience app oh also don't miss out on using the directions feature on the app to find your Festival fun a mistake I also see people making is sleeping on the garden Rocks concert series during the week that's because Tuesday through Thursday the concerts are either local bands or tribute bands I totally get waiting until there's a more iconic band playing because there are some huge names that come to this Festival this year my Millennial heart is beating for 98 degre Simple Plan and the plain white teas I am so excited about that one but the tribute bands can actually Rock just as hard I saw the tribute band foreigners Journey last year and it was an incredible show actually I've seen tons of concert series at different Epcot festivals and it's usually the 70s rockers that put on the best performance like Peter Noon and Mickey Thomas of Starship but there are also a couple of new acts this year including Maverick City Music which I'm a fan of some of these performers are really popular and there can be a really long line to see this free concert but if you don't want to wait for a long time or even potentially miss out on a concert because it filled up you can guarantee admission by getting a garden rocks dining package this not only guarantees a good meal but also a seat at the concert that night my vote for the dining package is always Morocco the is seriously underrated and it's really close to the American Gardens theater where the shows take place although there are multiple Epcot restaurants that are part of this serving options for breakfast lunch and dinner so whichever one works best for your Epcot day now I totally know this isn't always the case but if you have any flexibility on when you come to the festival or if you want to start planning for next year's Festival because it's never too early to dream about your next Disney trip try coming to the festival earlier in the Run everything is fresh and new and vibrant all from being recently installed plus you're probably going to get better weather the beginning Festival is like this little brief window before the harsh Florida summer really takes over although no matter when you do come to the festival get to the butterfly Landing earlier in the day it's a little less crowded and the butterflies are flitting about it's so precious in such a sweet place to hang out now the butterfly Landing doesn't have official opening hours it's kind of later morning and closes around dusk I love that such a beautiful thing is free with your Epcot admission especially as Disney is getting more expensive and more overwhelming but that doesn't mean you have to waste your time or money on this channel I break down exactly how to make the most of your Disney trip if you want to experience more magic and less dress at Disney subscribe cuz I got you covered as always I'm Molly and I'll meet you on Main Street"

      "transcript": "Disney World just made a huge change to some of its most popular rides if you have a Disney Vacation plant anytime soon this is definitely going to impact your trip this could completely change your Ride strategy because virtual cues for Tiana's Bayou adventure and Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic rewind are officially going away both rides are switching to traditional standby lines on February 25th so let's break down what is changing and exactly what you need to do to adjust your trip let's start with Pon since 2022 when Guardians the Galaxy Cosmic rewind open it always had a virtual queue meaning you had to be on the my toy experience app at 700 a.m. to get your boarding group to do the virtual queue it was the only way without paying that you could do this attraction Cosmic rewind will now have a standby queue just like every other ride at Disney World now this is where it gets complicated though early entry guests will also get access to this ride for the first time ever which is a big change this means you'll be able to get on the ride before the park officially opens if you are a Disney Resort guest or a guest of a hotel that is participating in brilliant tree now because Tron has also stopped its virtual queue this means that it's the first time since 2022 that there's been no virtual cues in Magic Kingdom editing Molly here clearly there are some issues with the audio so we're going to switch it up and take it from here okay so this sounds like great news no more waking up at 700 a.m. on what's supposed to be your vacation but what is this act actually mean for your trip these standby lines mean that Tiana in Cosmic rewind will attract guests earlier in the morning which will shift around the crowds now at Epcot Cosmic re wine could be the go-to attraction for early entry meanwhile Frozen and Remy's Ratatouille Adventure which are the current go-to attractions for early entry for epan in the know they might get a slight break earlier in the day since Guardians joining early entry could spread out people in the Parks more but this could mean longer wait times for those rides in the morning as guest move from guardians where they did early entry over to World Showcase and those attractions next now because both the current go-to early entry of Remy and Frozen are in World Showcase you were at a little bit of a disadvantage if you did not enter Epcot through the international Gateway but you now have a prime opport Unity to get in line for early entry at Guardians because it's at the front of the park when although if you're not one of those people I imagine that it will be more difficult to ROP drop Guardians because of the number of people that will already be entering from the front of the park now this is just speculation we'll see how it all goes once it's actually introduced on the 25th but I could potentially see Guardians being part of early entry increasing wait times for the other attractions in future world well what do we call that like World celebration area now World nature all that stuff in the front of the park and that's because people may after they knock out Guardians for early entry they may just stay in the front of the park and decide to knock out some other rides in that area like saurin or living with the land or spaceship earth instead of trying to beine it back to World Showcase but in addition to that often time day guests who do not have early entry will come in to the park and do the first rides they see which are the rides in future world so there's already an increase for wait times for future World rides even before this new early entry at Guardians has been implemented similarly attractions in Adventure Land are not open for early entry right now so think Jungle Cruise Pirates of the Caribbean which means these rides usually have low weight times in the morning because there's been no early entry guest in that area but now with Tiana being a standby line even more guests are going to prioritize rope dropping that side of the park plus the resort guest who did early entry in tomorrow land Fantasy Land they're also going to be making their way over to adventur land making that entire area potentially more crowded especially since Big Thunder Mountain isn't operational right now which could help absorb people we won't have that for a while now if doing the standby line at tanais is not a priority then I'd consider going to tomorrow land potentially and knocking out a bunch of things because early entry guests will probably be in fantasy land we'll have a lot of people in Adventure Land leave in Tomorrowland up for the taken likewise if Guardians is not a priority for you consider rope dropping Frozen or Ry especially as this new attraction joins the lineup I imagine more people will be going for that one at early entry now this is unless you have a lightning Lane these changes won't just impact morning strategy also might impact your lightning Lane strategy that's because while both of these attractions will now have standby lines they each will still have a paid lightning Lane option now putting back on my speculation hat because removing the virtual Q feature could go a couple of ways for lightning Lane availability it might make it easier to get lightning lanes for those attractions that were typically hard to snag because now there is an option to do standby before having a lightning Lane was the only way you could absolutely guarantee that you were going to get on the ride with the virtual queue in place there was no guarantee because if you didn't get the virtual queue you were out of luck so some people who may have bought lightning Lanes in the past may not anymore because now as long as you're willing to wait in the standby line you're going to get opportunity to ride it although on the flip side people who are really Savvy about getting virtual cues which allowed Disney to actually Pace out how many guests were riding at a time those previous virtual CU goers might opt for lightning Lane because of the unpredictability of the weight times when it comes to standby the weit times of what these attractions will actually be is a huge question mark right now now I think even without early entry in consideration Epcot mornings are really going to feel the impact of Guardians being standby probably expect maybe a 60 to 90 minute wait kind of like when Remy went to standby line that means if you were planning to rope drop Epcot get there even earlier than you were expecting these changes are for sure going to disperse crowds throughout the park in a different way which actually could be a good thing because in both cases it's now pulling people into opposite sides of the park which literally spreads out the crowds more so why is Disney making this change now virtual cues were originally in place to manage the high demand of new attractions and since both these rides have been open for a little bit now Disney might be wanting to reduce the confusion or the friction for guests however I also have to mention that this may be in part to Disney ramping up a series of really big projects especially at Magic Kingdom right near where Tiana's is and with all these projects and construction going on across Disney World they're going to literally need more space to put people so opening up those standby lines will do that and honestly I'm not mad about not having to wake up at 6:55 in the morning anymore because I am not a morning person there's a lot of variables still unknown about these changes so make sure to subscribe because I'm going to be testing different strategies so that you can do Disney ride and keep making magical memories as always I'm Molly and I'll meet you on Main Street"

      "transcript": "today we're tackling one of the most stressful parts of your Disney World vacation the virtual queue but I'm going to break everything down to help you secure a spot on these really incredible rides even when it's a busy day hi I'm Molly and I bring you Disney World tips so you can keep creating magical memories Disney's virtual Q system has been around for a couple years but it's even gotten some updates lately and if you're confused by any of it you're not alone but first what is it and how does it work all right so typically at Disney World want to ride something you just walk up and get in line but with the virtual que system it doesn't work that way instead you join the que or line by using your mind Disney Experience app this is where you'll be assigned a boarding group and then when your boarding group number is called you'll then be able to get in line for the attraction but the challenge here is that people swoop up these virtual Q spots in literally seconds and sometimes a virtual queue is the only way you'll get to ride an attraction now if you already know the 101 on Virtual queue use the time stamps down below and Skip ahead to the strategy because let's knock out some common questions first off does it cost money nope wo that's a relief the virtual queue is free but remember that Disney does offer some of these attractions in lightning Lane version that you will have to pay for however depending on the time of year and how busy the parks are those lightning Lanes may already be sold out by the time you're ready to go to the park so why is there even a virtual queue well Disney's been using virtual qes since 2019 with the going say with the release of Rise of resistance with the introduction of Rise of the resistance the goal of virtual cues is to help maintain crowd levels at really popular attractions especially when they first debut rides like Tron have used virtual Q in the past but it's important to know which rides are currently using virtual Q when you visit Disney World well then which rides have virtual cues fantastic question you will find this information on the first page of your my Disney EXP experience app or you can always search for virtual que and it will bring up your options although this isn't exclusively just to new ride openings Disney has been known to use Virtual queue for seasonal items like at some of the holiday parties can you have more than one virtual queue yes but with a very specific stipulation you can only hold one virtual Queue at a time meaning you have to have already had your boarding group called tapped into the ride and be in line before you're able to even be eligible for another virtual queue you can only get the standard regular Park hour virtual cues once per ride so no floating down the buy you twice in a day to clarify you can't have more than one virtual Queue at a time for an attraction but if you have a virtual queue for something like a meet and greet then you can have two going there is an exception however but this is why knowing when the virtual cues open up is so important because the virtual cues are not just an all day thing where you just pop in whenever there's availability they only open up at certain times each day those crucial times are at 7: a.m. each day you can join the virtual queue from anywhere anyone can join as long as you have a valid Park ticket although some Park tickets do require that you also have a Park reservation but if you have a date paced Park ticket which is most likely what you'll have unless you have an annual pass you don't have to worry about Park reservations anymore so if your ticket does require a Park reservation unless you have one of those as well as a valid ticket you won't be able to join the queue and then My Disney Experience app make it very clear if you are ineligible to join the virtual queue so you can try for either attraction at 700 a.m. but don't worry if you don't get the attraction you want virtual queue opens another time so you have another opportunity the next chance is at 1:00 p.m. how ever this time as opposed to being anywhere at all you have to be inside the park that you're wanting to get the virtual Q for meaning if you want to get Guardians you have to physically be inside of Epcot before 1 p.m. same with Magic Kingdom or any other virtual cues that happen in the future that means if you are Park hopping that day you need to make your way over into the second Park well before that 1 p.m. time so you are in place ready to go because being ready to book book your virtual queue is key to being successful with it I'll talk about that more in a little bit because there's actually one more opportunity to book a virtual que there is a bonus opportunity at 6:00 p.m. but only if you are staying in a Disney Deluxe Resort or Resort that has that Park like this one and dolphin now this third virtual queue option is only available for those guests and when the park has extended evening hours but first going back to those different virtual queue times does it matter when one you try for yes kind of because there's some things to consider now the 1 p.m. drop will be less competitive usually that's because there's a bit more of a barrier to entry because you have to actually be in the park to be eligible for that que drop plus some guests who may have been interested in that ride as well may have already gotten their boarding groups from the 7 a.m. one however even though there might be more of a chance of getting the virtual Queue at 1:00 p.m. that doesn't necessarily mean that it's a better time than 7 a.m. that's because making the virtual queue and getting a morning pass while definitely exciting first major hurdle done it actually doesn't mean you're 100% going to get on the ride there could be something like a delayed opening or unexpected closure something like that which creates an extended downtime for the ride making it that less people overall will get to experience the ride that day if you get a boarding group from the 7 a.m. drop you're more likely to have a lower boarding group number which means that it's more likely that you'll will get on the ride that day since they start lowest and work their way on up throughout the day whereas if you have a virtual queue for later in the day you might have a higher boarding group where if something happens they may not necessarily get to that boarding group being called for the ride if that were to happens definitely no bueno but at least you will have gotten a boarding group and what's that saying like it's better to have had a boarding group and lost a boarding group than never to have virtual cute at all or something like that now here's where we get serious because here is my step-by-step guide to joining the virtual queue first off double check that your tickets are registered to your My Disney Experience account and that you have a park pass just check those things off this way you are ready to go when the virtual queue opens because every second matters you want to have the My Disney Experience app open and ready to go well before the time that the virtual queue actually opens I always set an alarm on my phone for at least 2 minutes before the virtual queue opens but if this is a newer Strate for you you might even want to send alarm with more time right when you open the app you'll see on your main homepage or you should at least the virtual Q section now that is the fastest way to find it although if it's not popping up for some reason you can always search for virtual queue and it will bring you to the same spot then you'll want to confirm your party make sure that everyone who is going to be riding with you is linked which is also actually something you'll want to do before this time comes is make sure that all of your party members are linked and that you can make reservations for other people in your party now for the good stuff the absolute best way I found to join the virtual queue is to start about a minute before the virtual queue opens tapping the refresh button just just start rapidly hitting that refresh button that way as soon as the queue opens your finger is already in the exact spot it needs to be to press join the queue now there is an alternative option where you can swipe down and that refreshes the screen which when the time comes we'll also allow you to press the button to join the virtual queue but I found with the refresh method it takes a little bit longer for things to repopulate so Tap Away to make sure that you can hit that join the queue Button as soon as it becomes available you're going to want to have a strong connection so should you use Wi-Fi or your phone's data I'm usually a data fan but it really depends on which one is faster for you if you're at home Airbnb Resort it might make sense to log on to the Wi-Fi for this especially in the morning if you're inside the park may make more sense to use your cellular data since there will be more people on the Wi-Fi there you can check to see the internet speed that you're dealing with by using third party apps to see how things are looking and help you make that decision for joining the que I always use that refresh method that I just showed and I've gone in many many virtual cues but I did want to make you aware that there is another option and that is the world clock option so you'll need another phot for this one but you will have someone else with a world clock or very precise clock because you want to be able to see as soon down to the Nan second as soon as the queue opens you know 7:00 a.m. or 1 p.m. you want to then tap join Q all right so got your boarding group secure you are now Master of the virtual Q system what happens next once you've secured your boarding group you'll get a popup notification in the My Disney Experience app when your boarding group has been called that's what you're waiting for is to see when your specific numbered boarding group will be called back to wait in line also pple to have notifications enabled for the mind is experience app for this reason you can also look in the app itself usually on your homepage to see which boarding groups are currently being called so you can kind of see where they're at in the process as well as Disney provides an estimated return time this is of course just an estimate but it can kind of help you gauge your day then once you're boarding your business called you'll have 1 hour to return back to the attraction and tap in the boarding groups are normally called within a section of like 10 at a time so it's not just like 1 two three and then once your number is called you'll be then well getting in line now the virtual queue isn't a skip the line experience if you have a lightning Lane little bit of a different story but for virtual queue just means it's time to get in a line like normal so I've usually waited like 30 to 45 minutes so factor in some actual wait time for the attraction as you're planning your day too that's why you'll actually often see people waiting around the entrance of Attraction when their boarding group is getting close that way they can get on the ride as soon as possible now it can be kind of hectic if you get that notification and say you're on the other side of the park and World Showcase don't worry there's usually about a 15minute grace period after the hours up where they'll usually still let you tap in again always subject to crowd levels and kind of what's going on but usually that's the case ultimately once your number's called you tap in you get in line you ride ride and have a great rest of your day so whether you're tackling Tiana Guardians of the Galaxy or who knows whatever the next thing is that Disney rolls out these tips will help you maximize your day at the park however you really need to watch this video to make sure you're getting the most out of your Disney day as always I'm Molly and I'll meet you on Main Street"

      "transcript": "we're here at Disney's Rivier resort to figure out if the bruncher is worth the Hefty price tag to figure out definitively if this was worth it I'm going to be judging the restaurant on three criteria food character interactions and atmosphere but let's cover some Basics first topalo Terrace is located in Disney's Rivier Resort it's a character meal where you can meet some classic Disney friends and it's a prefixed menu which that in and of itself makes this a really unique character dining experience since this character meal opened with the restaurant it's an incredibly immersive experience and completely unlike some of the other character dining options around Disney World you can get to Topolino's Terrace by taking a Disney bus driving or taking the Disney Skyliner because this is one of the resorts that is connected to the Disney Skyliner what's also fantastic about that especially if you get an earlier breakfast at talino is that you can then be one of the first people into Epcot or Hollywood Studios by a jumping on over to the Skyliner we're if you're driving to the restaurant and you have a dining reservation you can park there for free no problem cuz usually parking is only reserved for overnight Resort guests however if you're planning on taking the Skyliner to toino Terrace The Skyliners don't start running until about an hour before the park opens so keep that in mind as you are booking your reservations but we got some food to eat and and some characters to meet before we think about popping into a theme park the restaurant is located at the top of the resort on the left side if you're coming in through the lobby but we did have a little bit of a of an obstacle because oh going down elevators weren't running until about 7:45 but our reservation was before that fortunately a kind cast member helped us figure out what was going on and a short detour later we were ready for our experience papalo Terrace is one of my favorite Disney World restaurants I come here all the time for dinner however we haven't been here for breakfast in like 3 years so I'm interested to see if it truly lives up to the expectation and the Hye that we've placed on this now this Character Breakfast is a little bit different than some of the other ones around Disney Disney World this is a seated plated breakfast as opposed to Character Breakfast that are buffets which is the option around most of the property the Rivier Resort is one of the newest Disney Resorts and this restaurant specifically is a signature dining experience in the evening meaning it's one of the nicest at Disney World and fortunately that carries over into the breakfast as well the restaurant is spacious and light and Airy leaving plenty of room for character experience and that incredible quality of food for dinner that carries over as well for breakfast which is a really good thing because price right now for adults is $49 per adult but what you get for that in addition to the character meet and greets is a prefixed venue where you get select beverages a bread and pastry basket as well as an entree of your choice but our super kind and awesome customer Sarah from Minnesota got us a little taste of a waffle as well because I wanted something a little sweet to go with our steak and eggs both Aron and I ordered the steak and eggs and they are delicious that's one thing about the restaurant here for both breakfast and dinner but it's especially noticeable at breakfast and that is the upscale nature of the food this is really good quality food basic drinks are included in the price things like coffee water juice they even have fog juice which we had to get but for an additional charge there are some specialty drinks like cocktails and especially coffees like The Fringe breast we got as well as my vanilla latte because I love me a vanilla latte this is one of the hardest to get dining reservations so make sure that when your dining window opens for your trip which is 60 days before the first day of your trip you are ready to book this now if you're staying at a Disney Resort you can actually book for the entire length of your stay up to 10 days most dining reservations will open at 6:00 a.m. eastern time although you can use my favorite Disney dining hack which is actually how I got us reservations for this experience and that is to check on reservations the night before or even the day of because oftentimes people will cancel their reservations last minute which frees up reservations especially for some hard to get restaurants the theme of this breakfast is a breakfast Alla art so our favorite Disney friends are dressed in their artistic finery introduce to you our sculptor in Residence Sor Donald Duck a warm welcome to our P residence ofor Mick M and they are so fun to interact with these have been a amazing character interactions I never felt rush I saw characters multiple times there's even a cute little dance around the restaurant that happens about once an hour [Music] yeah Daisy and of course their adorable outfits are just the icing on top I think that this is probably some of the best character interaction I've ever had actually the whole restaurant really gives luxurious upscale athetic to it so it's a little bit different than say getting a character meal at like Chef Mickey's which airs a little a little bit more on the chaotic side let's say and as if the awesome character interactions and amazing food weren't enough there is a spectacular view here at Topolino's Terrace you cannot miss coming out on the Terrace and getting a bird's eye view of Disney World you can see into Epcot Hollywood Studios and tons of Disney Resorts so I'm giving this restaurant an eight out of 10 for atmosphere but the character interactions as well that will be n out of 10 so overall very high score for Rivia Resort now the whole reason we came to top alino Terrace this morning was to celebrate I have reached a thousand subscribers on this channel and my mind is absolutely blown I am so humbled by everyone who has shown up to watch a video or left a comment or subscribed it is so incredible and overwhelming and what I'm most excited about is that this is going to enable me to show up in even more and better ways for you because my whole passion my whole goal with this channel is to provide you information and tips so that you can make the most of your next Disney vacation and ultimately make magical memories that will last you a lifetime I am so so grateful for this I cannot even begin to express how thrilled I am thank you and as always and in case you're new here I'm Molly and I'll meet you on Main Street"

      "transcript": "what the heck is going on at Disney World well we just got some big news for Disney's Hollywood Studios after months of hotly contested speculation within the Disney fan Community Disney officially announced that the new monster Z Clan is coming right here to mu's Courtyard that means that this area of the park and everything right around us is going to close forever very soon there are for sure pros and cons to this but also like where's Muppet Vision going to go first off here is what Disney officially confirmed Muppet's Courtyard and everything here in the Grand Avenue area will be closing down all of the shops around here the restaurants like pizza Rizzo Mama Melrose it's all going to be transformed into monstropolis the highlight of this new land the suspended coaster that's going to be like the door scene at the end sounds like it's going to be really Ive really thrilling and it's actually pretty cool because this ride concept has been floating around the Disney fandom for years so to get confirmation that this ride is actually happening was pretty fun and that happened when Disney announced it at the recent d23 Expo a couple of months ago and along with that they released this concept art but even despite announcing a lot of things for this area at the Expo the one big thing they didn't mention was where in Hollywood Studios is it going so does that mean that this is the end of the Muppets at Disney world it's actually not the last we're going to see of the Muppets in this park even now as for what is specifically going to happen to the Muppet Vision theater heard rumors that it might be turned into a different kind of theatrical show that fits with the Monsters Inc theme but what about the actual film because it's pretty important well Disney has said as we move forward with these changes we are having creative conversations and exploring ways to preserve the film and other parts of the experience for fans to enjoy in the future however since the good news is that the Muppets aren't leaving entirely where are they headed exactly this door coaster isn't the only fan theory that has been floating around for a couple years now that Disney today actually made a reality and that's because the Muppets are heading over to rock and roller coaster to rock along with some of the greatest that's about all we know right now although this will be the first Disney ride to feature The Muppets so while I truly am devastated that Muppet Vision is going away and I'll talk a little bit more about my real feelings on this in a second I am however excited that they are at least getting reinvigorated in a different way one downside though is rock and roller coaster currently has a 48 in height minimum hoping that the new door coaster doesn't have such restrictions because it's replacing an attraction that currently everyone can enjoy so when can we actually expect these changes well monsters inkland is set to begin Construction in 2025 although we have no other timeline except for that and there also hasn't been an official announcement about when Muppet Vision is actually closing likewise with Rock and roller coaster but Disney did say that there's still quote plenty of time to enjoy those attractions although maybe experience it sooner rather than later if you're a fan it's been really interesting being here tonight hours after they made this announcement cuz I met so many people who just love the Muppets and are so upset about this leaving and upset about the announcement I hard just is really sad for people I try to keep things light and happy on the channel because I think that even though Disney makes decisions that um sometimes we're not fans of that's why I'm so passionate about focusing in on making magical memories with the ones you love because that's something that no matter what other changes happen to these Parks that's something that will never go away I'm really curious to hear what you think of this announcement so definitely tell me down in the comments below my honest thoughts on this news is pretty divided because on the one hand I'm thrilled anytime the Disney company is inv investing in its theme parks also anytime they invest in Hollywood Studios which if you're new to this channel my name is Molly I give you Disney tips to help you keep creating magical memories but I'm also a really big fan of Hollywood Studios this was my favorite Park growing up it's the park where I was a cast member at so it's very special to me so I like when it gets a little love however this is just one more reminder that the park I loved when I was younger just isn't really around anymore I don't know how much they're actually going to tear down any of these buildings that have very much an old school Hollywood Studios MGM Studios Vibe versus how much they just kind of repurpose them but does kind of remind me that it's not the park I used to know I am sad that all of the incredible details of this area are going to go away the amazing theming I'm sad that this historic movie is going to go somewhere it is the last production that Jim hson himself worked on before he passed away and this was his last performance as Kermit the Frog so I think that it really should be immortalized in some way and I hope that it's a way that makes it still accessible to Disney fans although if I'm being honest it's been far too long since I actually sat down and appreciate the [Music] show I'm supposed to go L me through my head"

      "transcript": "Real Talk animal kingdom is not the first Park you think about when you think Christmas at Disney world but that's a mistake because there's actually so many incredible hidden gyms for the holidays here and let me show you why you shouldn't miss it this holiday season the magic starts before you even walk into the park there's a massive Christmas tree at the entrance it's the perfect way to start your day with some holiday cheer oh and if we haven't met hi I'm Molly and I'm all about helping you play in your best Disney vacation with tips so that you can keep creating magical memor but back to number five which is the incredible holiday decorations while Discovery Island this area right around the tree of life is Decked Out BBE pun intended is decked out with these really beautiful wintry inspired PL turns and beautiful lights that kind of look like they're coming off of branches so beautiful but actually there's so much more of the park that is decorated for the holidays animal Kingdom's holiday Decor is unlike anything you'll see in any other park because it reflects the Park's Global cultural theme each area of the park has truly unique decorations that Mak sense for the land that they're in in dinoland USA you'll find quirky colorful Christmas decor popular holiday [Music] music and even Santa's new setup at restaurantosaurus which we'll Circle back to that in a bit over in Asia the park celebrates dwali the Festival of Lights with glowing lanterns and floral garlands that are stunning at night you'll find this outside of the upshow in Africa you'll find subtle yet beautiful holiday touches with handmade ornaments colorful garlands and festive details that reflect the vibrant culture of the land even Pandora gets in on the holiday spirit blending the natural beauty of the alien moon with Earth Traditions there is na'vi inspired Garland Christmas lights on the amp suit and even a manora decor ated and Pandora's signature style it's such a creative mix of cultural and festive magic that truly makes Animal Kingdom stand out although nothing is quite as magical as meeting a Jolly Old St Nick himself at Disney World no less Christmas Merry Christmas I am thank you here in Dino Land you can meet Santa Claus at the dino institute's Christmas party this is the first year that you can meet Santa at Animal Kingdom and it might be the last since he's over in Dino Land outside of restaurant asaurus that's why this is number four on my list the theming is so creative in this area the dino Institute team has gone all out for their Christmas party with precious Dino inspired decorations everywhere I just had a great time standing in line looking at all these little details you can find Santa across from the attraction dinosaur to get their head to restaurantosaurus then go off to the left and you'll spot him on your right meet and greet times are available ailable on the My Disney Experience app I hopped in line for the last time slot at 3:30 and waited only a few minutes he is out there for about an hour at a time however after I came out of the restaurant after enjoying my sweet treat he was just heading off to the North Pole and that was around 450 if you're in line you know say 30 45 minutes after the meet and greet start time you should be good to be able to see him but let's back it up to the street now here's a quick bonus seasonal treat this year's standout is the snack for Santa which you'll find at restaurantosaurus and pizzafari it's a chocolate chip cake topped to cookie dough mousse it sprinkles and let me tell you it's as delicious as it is festive definitely grab one while you're here at number three we have the extra entertainment in characters and festive outfits that you'll only find during the holidays throughout the park live performers sprinkle and holiday inspired music adding to the festive atmosphere [Music] characters like Mickey Donald and Daisy are all dressed in their adorable holiday outfits even chip andell got the assignment with the Chipmunks pretending to be dinosaurs pretending to be reindeer at night the Tree of Life Awakenings brings the park to life with heartwarming holiday projections and music the animation is beautiful and the stories follow different animals having some wintertime marent the show begins after Sundown on this day that I visited it began exactly 30 minutes after sunset at 6:05 since the Park closed at 6: p.m. that day um I recommend spending your entire park time doing attractions since the Awakening didn't even begin until after official park closing time I almost hopped on a 15minute wait for na'vi River Journey but didn't want to miss the projections but really turns out I easily could have done both there are also multiple vignettes for the Awakenings plus the Awakenings happen every couple of minutes there was about 4 minutes between these two shows you can see the holiday stories from many areas around Discovery Island so you don't have to camp out for a spot you just walk up and enjoy the magic and that's one of the best things about Animal Kingdom at the holidays coming in at number two is something that makes Animal Kingdom a dream during this time of year how empty the park gets especially in the evening while everyone flocks to Magic Kingdom or Epcot animal kingdom is one of the most peaceful places to this time of year ride weight times are ridiculously short you can hop on like Expedition Everest with almost no weight plus with fewer crowds you can take your time really soaking in the details of the Park's holiday decor and atmosphere for a park as incredibly immersive as Animal Kingdom having a relaxing not swelteringly hot time to explore the details is a rare treat it's like having the park almost to yourself the low crowd levels in earlier part closure time also makes it easy to check off several things that animal King om then hop on over to another park for the rest of the evening and the number one reason animal kingdom is an underrated holiday [Music] gym the Mary managerie this enchanting experience features life-sized animal puppets like polar bears reindeer penguins and more I cannot even describe how precious this is it is just just full of holiday magic you walk into Animal Kingdom Here on Discovery Island you have the tree of life behind you and these absolutely precious puppets all around you there's even a musician walking around doing holiday music as well it might just sound like these are puppets but I can't even explain how the amazing puppeteers bring them to life they are gorgeous puppets that match all the decoration around here on Discovery Island it is so precious so heartwarming exactly what you're looking for for Disney World Christmas it's 510 and the mar managerie just went away so get here no later than around 4:45 5ish if you want to catch them they start around 10ish in the morning if you do nothing else but just walk into Animal Kingdom interact with the Mary managerie and leave you won't regret it it's pure holiday joy and something you won't find anywhere else in Disney World although Disney World is filled with unique offerings during the holiday season and to keep making the most of your holidays at Disney World check out this video here with tons of more information as always I'm Molly and

      "transcript": "one of the most controversial events is back at Disney World this year and I'm going to convince you why you should attend this is your ultimate guide to jollywood nights this entirely unique celebration is packed with exclusive entertainment rare character encounters best of food and drinks and a retro Hollywood vibe that is equal parts classic and cozy I've poured over every detail that you need to know this year starting with what's new entertainment is a huge part of this event and it is so well done and this year Disney said I hear you and going to double down with even more amazing entertainment dizzy has added even more magic to jollywood nights this year with glisten and ice skating show this is where you can watch worldclass figure skaters perform to Holiday Classics and Disney Classics and is right here on Hollywood Boulevard that's right there is an ice skating show in Florida talk about some Disney Magic the show is available at 8:15 9:15 10:30 11:15 and 12:15 but how do you know which of those show times to go to well I'll get into that a little bit later with this video because we also have new this year a Pixar Place dance party well disco party actually it's featuring characters like Frozone and Edam mode and you can join in on the festivities oh and Joy's going to be there as well you can meet Joy this year too and these festivities will be happening over in the Pixar area this is just before you get into Toy Story Land if you're not going to Galaxy's Edge side of Toy Story Land this is a perfect spot for some energetic fun and hanging out out with your favorite characters but speaking of favorite characters there are a bunch of new ones this year for the event Belo and King Louie in their tail spin attire we've got Jose and petito over in the animation Courtyard area and then we've got Lotto or B peep at the entrance of Toy Story Land so characters everywhere there are tons of fun photo ops throughout the event and new this year there is one inspired by the essential Millennial Christmas classic a Muppet Christmas Carol you can find that The Muppets company store which is just past Pizza Rizzo but Pro tip don't miss out on these photo ops because all of the pictures and videos from this event at the photo pass stations are free they are included as part of the event olly the gingerbread mascot of jollywood nights is back with some exclusive merge like Spirit jerseys and headbands including a passholder exclusive shirt this year sounding pretty fun so far but this is only the beginning of the information you need to know if you're considering this event or if you already have a ticket here so let's take it back to beginning and talk about Deeds jollywood nights is a special ticketed event that means that this is something separate from a regular Hollywood Studios park ticket although I don't think that if you're attending this event you should buy a ticket to Hollywood Studios and I'll share a little bit more about that when I get to my tips section jollywood nights run select Nights from November 9th to December 21st the event officially kicks off at 7:30 p.m. and runs until 12:30 a.m. but party guests can enter the park as early as 600 p.m. a full hour and a half before the park closes today guest meaning you've got a full 90 minutes before the event starts where you can enjoy just regular Hollywood Studios things like getting on rides grabbing some food now the Disney website says event guests are allowed in at 600 p.m. but I've seen it on some other websites that you could maybe get in earlier so I'll have to test that out once the event really gets going but I will leave an updated information about that in the description of this video right now it is 7:00 and folks are already lining up for some of the character meet and greets if you are attending the event you will get a special wristband that will indicate that you are here for the party you can get that at the front of the park there will be a separate line for guests that are entering for the event but if you're already in the park you can go pick up your wristband over at Muppets 3D or at the Star Wars launch bay area now tickets are going to cost you between $159 and 179 but if you are Disney Vacation Club annual passholder or or even a cast member you may be able to save a couple of bucks so keep those dollars if you can now one of the reasons I love this event is because it is Peak Disney adult now as of this recording all party dates are still available but tonight the first night did sell out so I expect to see more parties start to fill up as we go I love Disney entertainment and that's what makes this event really a standout for me is all the incredible entertainment that they offer starting with this campness Disney holidays in Hollywood this Broadway style stage show is hosted by none other than Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy it's over at theater of the Stars this is on Sunset Boulevard where Beauty and the Beast normally plays during the day the show combines old Hollywood charm with festive flare the performers are spectacular with some really top tier dancing watching Mickey Buster move delightful you can catch the shows at 8:15 9:15 11:15 and 12:15 Pro tips since this is an essential part of this event catch an earlier show that way it is checked off and it clears you up for activities later in the event hosted by Jack Skellington what's this A Nightmare Before Christmas sing along is an interactive singalong show at the Hyperion theater perfect for fans of Nightmare Before Christmas it's a mix of holiday and Halloween with characters like Oogie Boogie making an appearance it's a really unique show because the performance don't speak but act and dance throughout I'm not the biggest fan of Nightmare Before Christmas but this unique take on the show really won me over cash performances at 7:30 8 :30 9:30 11:30 and 12:30 Pro tip that last show at 12:30 technically begins once the event is over so to really maximize your event time head to that last show Hollywood Studios is bringing back its holiday fireworks show jingle bell jingle bam for this event make sure to catch this over the Chinese Theater now there's only one showtime and that's at 10 p.m. if you've never seen the show before there are projections on the Chinese Theater if you can find a seat where you can can see the theater ideal now if this firework show is a must for you stake out a spot early because again there's only the one Showtime it does look like they're allowing people to purchase exclusive food items before the event actually begins which will help with the lines the next fit of entertainment really brings out the old Hollywood Glitz you can hear a live jazz fand performing spooky yet festive Tunes outside of the Tower of Terror the Twilight sare at the tiptop club at the Tower of Terror happens right outside the exit to the ride it's like you've been invited to an old Hollywood party there okay so I just heard the cast MERS say that if you are here for the ice skating show you will sit down if you are inside of this tapel line and then you'll stand up if you are outside of the tape line meeting your favorite Disney friends is always fun but what makes disant unique are all the rare characters that you get to meet there's a whole '90s throwback area by echol Lake where you can meet chip Andale Rescue Rangers as well as Max scoop as power line and vinas and FB I guess they're more like 2000s but they're retro now too which is kind of crazy to think about anyway you'll also be able to meet the Mandalorian and baby Yoda in Galaxy's Edge Santa Duffy is at Santa's Workshop over in Grand Avenue Disney says there are over 20 unique character experiences at the event this year and the holiday festival a Cali so sorry I probably butcher that it's a vibrant scene with warm lighting colorful Decor spirited musicians performing Latin holiday Tunes from 7:30 to 12:30 now although this is not party exclusive it is a good reminder that a lot of the most popular attractions will also be available during the event since the park will be at reduced capacity this could be a fantastic time to ride fan favorite rides and you'll probably have some shorter wait times oh also this year rise of the resistance is not going to be in a virtual queue like it was last event season it's just going to be a standby line if getting on as many Disney rides as possible is part of your Christmas list you'll want to use your time strategically at this event head to those popular attractions during showtimes or While others are in line for characters and an especially good time will be during the fireworks since it's only shown once most people will be pulled to that now the holidays are about yummy foods and one of the best parts I think you'd agree of a Disney World vacation are the delicious treats greetings everyone what I was saying is also that one of the best parts of a Disney World vacation are the yummy treats you get to have so add those two things together and you get things like Kermit's frozen banana Bliss agent be rissant holiday turkey popover cocktails like the mistletoe martini and the one treat I regret not getting last year the Santa gery cookie and you can get this sugar cookie at different locations throughout the event there is a complete foodie guide that showcases every delicious treat you can get at jollywood nights over on the Disney parks blog website most food offerings at the event are going to be quick service however there is one table service offering and that is the Jazzy holidays over at the Brown Derby they offer an evening of smooth holiday Tunes with a live pianist and some exclusive festive holiday bites this is not the regular Brown Derby menu this was also an absolutely chaotic part of the event last year but this year they've already made a revision that's going to smooth out the process so much and that is that you can book dining reservations for this experience book dining for Jazzy holidays just like you would any other restaurant at Disney world through the website or My Disney Experience app this is great because it will help you plan out your event even easier and that is one of the biggest tips when it comes to a special event at Disney World this party will fly by you'll walk in thinking I have 5 hours all the time in the world and before you know it the clock has struck midnight or 12:30 at this point and the party will have ended I suggest picking two to three non-negotiables for the event prioritize those once you've done those priority items anything else is just a bonus now before the event even begins you want to make sure that you are here well before that start time like you saw people were already starting to line up around 6:45 7 so even though the event technically begins at 7:30 there's there's already a lot going on so if you arrive just at 7:30 you're already going to be a bit behind the game also would consider not doing a park day here at Hollywood Studios because you get into Hollywood Studios before the event even begins use that time to do the regular Park things and then spend that 5 hours of the event doing exclusively event items some really special characters like Santa Duffy will especially have very long lines so meet those characters towards the end of the night when lines have died down you can see a full rundown of character locations on your event map that map is crucial because it's your go-to source for Everything Party related but you can also use the My Disney Experience app search for jollywood nights and you'll see tons of information about the event including a digital map which will also show you things like directions to get to which party exclusive thing you want to get to as well as you can use this to plan your event itinerary before you even get there although if you have no idea to start if we haven't met my name is Molly and I bring you Disney tips and strategies so that you can keep creating magical memories here's a sample itinerary again customize it to fit your priorities and must 5:30 get to Hollywood Studios and check in 6:00 do non jollywood nights activities like attractions have a meal so that you're not spending event time eating a full meal but instead are snacking or even see Fantasmic which will offer a 6:30 show on jollywood nights 7:15 get in line for your first party exclusive so characters attraction pictures treats something like that then make your way over to your first entertainment which is the 815 Disney holidays in Hollywood after that check out the 850 Twilight Suare set as you make your way out of the show then head over to the 9:15 glisten that way you're already in place for the fireworks show at 10:00 jingle bell jingle bam at 10:30 soak up the Atmosphere by checking out the dance parties meeting more characters exploring merchandise guys or you could even check out the 1110 Twilight Suare set if you missed the earlier one then cap off your night at 12:30 with The Nightmare Before Christmas singal along now if you're still on the fence see what this party is like for yourself by clicking this video here because this party is too expensive and I don't want you wasting your time or money so it's really important to kind of have a heads up of what you can expect during the event as always I'm Molly and I'll meet you on Main Street"
