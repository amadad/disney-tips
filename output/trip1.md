# Disney World Trip Tips

## Park Updates

- As of 2024, there have been several significant updates across Disney World. Notably, the Disney buses now offer Wi-Fi and charging ports, making them a more appealing transportation option. New buses with improved features like modular seating and more charging ports have been introduced. Additionally, parking at Disney World hotels now strictly requires either a room booking or a table service dining reservation. EPCOT's festival dates have seen changes with the Flower and Garden Festival running from February 28th until May 27th, suggesting potential adjustments to the Food and Wine Festival schedule. Important attraction updates include Tiana's Bayou Adventure and Country Bear Jamboree in Magic Kingdom, set to reopen by summer 2024. The Voyage of the Little Mermaid show in Hollywood Studios has permanently closed, with a new show expected in Fall 2024. Rock 'n' Roller Coaster is undergoing a major refurbishment, with a reopening planned for summer 2024. [1]
- Recent changes at Disney World include the addition of Tiana's Bayou Adventure, set to open later in the year as a replacement for Splash Mountain in Magic Kingdom. EPCOT has nearly completed its revitalization, with most construction walls down. New attractions include the Tron Lightcycle Run in Magic Kingdom and the Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind in EPCOT. A new 'Journey of Water' walkthrough attraction inspired by Moana is also now open in EPCOT. [2]
- Recent updates include the introduction of the Genie+ system, a skip-the-line service with an additional fee on top of your normal park ticket per person. There are also Lightning Lanes, where you pay to skip lines on certain attractions. The return of the Disney Dining Plan has been much discussed, with opinions divided on its value. [3]
- Walt Disney World Park hopping is returning to all day without restrictions starting January 9, 2024. Additionally, Tiana's Bayou Adventure is set to open in late 2024. Major changes are also anticipated for Genie+, although specific details are yet to be announced. Notably, Disney's Genie service, including Genie+, has three tiers, offering various ways to skip lines and optimize your park visit. [4]
- Several exciting updates are kicking off in Disney World, including the opening of Tiana's Bayou Adventure in Frontierland, updating Star Tours with new scenes from the 'Ahsoka' series, a major reimagining planned for Dino Land in Disney's Animal Kingdom, the introduction of the Hatbox Ghost in the Haunted Mansion, and a major retheme of Test Track in Epcot. [5]
- Several major closures and updates are happening in Disney World in 2024. Frontierland faces changes with Splash Mountain reimagined to Tiana's Bayou Adventure and the Country Bears getting a new act. The Typhoon Lagoon Water Park is closed for refurbishments, with only Blizzard Beach open. Rock 'n' Roller Coaster will close beginning January 8th with no re-opening date listed. Early park closures for private events may occur throughout the year. Additional potential changes include the overhaul of Dinoland U.S.A., updates to Test Track, a new Adventure Land Tavern, and plans beyond Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. [6]
- The Country Bear Jamboree attraction will be getting an update and temporarily closing in 2024. Tiana's Bayou Adventure, the retheme of Splash Mountain, is expected to open by the end of 2024. [7]

## Best Time To Visit

- While Disney World can be enjoyed year-round, planning your visit around park construction, refurbishment schedules, and festival dates can optimize your experience. Avoiding peak holidays and summer months can also result in shorter wait times and more pleasant weather. [1]
- The best times to visit Disney World for lower prices and shorter wait times are in January (from the second week) and May. August has low crowds but is in the peak of Florida's hot and rainy season. September also sees lower crowds. Prices and crowds peak in December, especially the week before Christmas through New Year's. [2]
- The best times to visit to avoid crowds are the first week after the New Year until February, the weeks between Thanksgiving and a week or two before Christmas, and from the end of August until about October. However, February is highlighted for its pleasant weather and comparatively lower crowds. [3]
- The best times to visit Disney World are during the slower seasons, typically in January after the holidays until before spring break starts in March. This is when you can expect lower crowd levels. [4]
- To avoid crowds and enjoy milder weather, visiting in late winter (late January to early February) or during the fall (late September to early November) is recommended. However, be aware of the Disney Skyliner's routine maintenance closure from January 16th to January 27th, 2024. [5]
- Avoid times of major refurbishments, early park closures for private events, and peak season times like winter holidays and Spring Break. Check the Disney World hours and events calendar for specific dates. [6]
- The best time to visit Disney World tends to be during the less crowded months, typically in late January to early February, and late April to early June, just before school summer vacations begin. [7]
- To avoid long lines and large crowds, it's recommended to visit Disney World during the off-peak seasons, typically from late January to early February, or late August through September. Visiting on weekdays can also help avoid large weekend crowds. [8]

## Premium Tips

- Disney Genie+ and individual Lightning Lane passes can sell out, especially during peak seasons. To ensure availability, purchase Genie+ at midnight on the day of your visit and book individual Lightning Lanes early in the morning or upon park opening if staying off property. Remember, you can make your first Lightning Lane selection at 7:00 AM. [1]
- Take advantage of Genie+ and Lightning Lane selections to reduce wait times for attractions. Purchase individual Lightning Lane selections for top-tier rides immediately at park opening time or at 7:00 a.m. if staying on-site. Use Genie+ to make reservations throughout the day, strategizing to stack reservations for popular rides. [2]
- Invest in Genie+ and Individual Lightning Lanes for popular attractions to save time. Also, consider attending special ticketed events like Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party for unique experiences. [3]
- Purchase Genie+ early on busy days as it can sell out. Guests can book their first Lightning Lane at 7 a.m. Resort guests have the added benefit of booking Individual Lightning Lanes at the same time. Use the modify button to change Lightning Lane selections easily. [4]
- To ensure you get on popular rides like Tiana's Bayou Adventure, Tron Lightcycle Run, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind, and others, consider purchasing Individual Lightning Lane access. Use the My Disney Experience app for timely virtual queue enrollment or to purchase Lightning Lane passes. [5]
- Disney Genie, Lightning Lanes, and Park Hopper options can help navigate busy days. Disney Genie+ will update its system, allowing guests to preselect Lightning Lanes ahead of their trip. [6]

## Budget Tips

- Visit during the off-peak seasons for lower accommodation and ticket prices. Consider staying off-site for substantial savings on accommodations. Use ride-sharing services like Uber or Lyft for airport transportation instead of dedicated bus services to save money. [2]
- Mix park days with pool days, skip the Park Hopper ticket if visiting multiple days, buy Disney gift cards in advance or in bulk at a discount, bring your own food and groceries, buy souvenirs ahead of time, and consider staying off-property or at Good Neighbor hotels to save money. [3]
- Consider not purchasing Genie+ during slower seasons or if visiting Epcot or Animal Kingdom due to fewer attractions. Use the rope drop strategy to ride popular rides with minimal wait and prioritize free virtual queues and individual Lightning Lanes for top attractions. [4]
- Maximize FastPass+ selections by booking early, use Disney transportation for free park access, and bring your own snacks and refillable water bottles to save on food costs. Purchase souvenirs and Disney-themed items before your trip from less expensive retailers. [5]
- Avoid unnecessary premium add-ons and consider grocery delivery services like Kroger's to save on food costs. Budget ahead for potential price increases in tickets, food, and merchandise. [6]
- Save money by bringing your own snacks and water bottles into the park. Purchase Disney gift cards at a discount before your trip and use them to pay for food, merchandise, and tickets. [7]
