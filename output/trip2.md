# Disney World Trip Tips

## Park Updates
- As of 2024, Disney buses now feature free Wi-Fi and charging ports. New modular seating buses accommodate more guests and ECVs/wheelchairs. Strict parking policies for non-hotel guests at Disney hotels: must have a table service dining reservation. Grand Floridian now requires diners to park in the cast member lot across the street. Epcot's Flower and Garden Festival dates have changed; it runs from February 28th to May 27th, 2024. Large remodels and new restaurant openings at Disney's Boardwalk. 1900 Park Fair at Grand Floridian reopening April 10th, 2024 with new characters and a refreshed dining experience.
- Walt Disney World is undergoing significant changes. Tiana's Bayou Adventure, replacing Splash Mountain, is set to open later this year. EPCOT has seen a near-complete revitalization with construction walls down, introducing new attractions like Journey of Water inspired by Moana and the Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind family coaster. Magic Kingdom has introduced the Tron Light Cycle Run, a high-speed coaster.
- Recent updates include the introduction of Genie+, a skip-the-line service, and Lightning Lanes for faster access to attractions. Additionally, certain attractions like Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind or Tron can only be accessed through a virtual queue or individual Lightning Lane purchase.
- In 2024, Disney World is introducing significant changes to park hopping, allowing guests to hop between parks all day without restrictions starting January 9th. This is a change from the previous rule that allowed hopping only after 2:00 PM. Additionally, Tiana's Bayou Adventure is expected to open in late 2024, though it's yet to be determined if it will be included in Genie+ or as an individual Lightning Lane selection.
- Tiana's Bayou Adventure, a reimagined log flume ride based on The Princess and the Frog, is set to open by the end of 2024 in Frontierland, Magic Kingdom. It replaces Splash Mountain. Also, updates to Star Tours in Hollywood Studios with new scenes, including ones based on the Ahsoka Disney Plus series, are expected by spring 2024. Additionally, a major reimagining of DinoLand in Animal Kingdom is underway, potentially incorporating themes from Encanto and Indiana Jones.
- 2024 Disney World updates include major ride renovations and park changes. Splash Mountain is being reimagined as Tiana's Bayou Adventure, set to open sometime in 2024. The Country Bear Jamboree is also getting an update. The Rock 'n' Roller Coaster will be temporarily closed for maintenance beginning January 8th, 2024, with no listed reopening date. Various early park closures for private events or parties may occur throughout the year. Several other potential updates based on rumors from the Destination D23 event might also transpire, involving Dinoland USA and other areas.
- Recent highlights include the upcoming Tiana's Bayou Adventure set to replace Splash Mountain by the end of 2024, Country Bear Jamboree receiving an update, and the addition of the Tron Lightcycle Run as the newest attraction.

## Best Time To Visit
- Avoiding spring break and around the holidays can help you miss the crowds and higher prices. Additionally, if interested in Epcot's festivals, adjusting your trip dates according to the new festival schedules (e.g., the Flower and Garden Festival is shorter in 2024) might be beneficial.
- Prices, crowds, and wait times are generally lower in January (after the first week), May, and late August. However, late August also experiences high temperatures, heavy rainfall, and an increased risk of hurricanes. September is similar in terms of crowd levels with cooler temperatures but remains warm enough for water parks.
- The first week after New Year until just before President's Day, the week following Thanksgiving until a few weeks before Christmas, and from late August to October are considered somewhat slower seasons. However, post-COVID, no time is distinctly 'slow'. Early February is recommended for weather and crowd levels.
- The best time to visit Disney World is during the off-peak seasons, typically January through early March (before Spring Break) and late April through early June, avoiding holidays and summer months when the parks are most crowded.
- To avoid the potential closure of rides for refurbishment or updates, such as the temporary shutdown of the Disney Skyliner for routine maintenance from January 16 through January 27, 2024, plan your visit outside of these dates. Additionally, considering the popularity and potential opening dates of new attractions like Tiana's Bayou Adventure, late 2024 might be an opportune time to experience the newest offerings.
- Considering both the current trends in crowd levels and the ongoing construction and refurbishment projects, the best times to visit Disney World in 2024 would likely be in the late winter to early spring months (late February to early April) or the fall season (late September to early November), avoiding major holidays and events.
- To avoid crowds and enjoy moderate weather, the best times to visit Disney World are from mid-January to early March and from late April to early June.

## Premium Tips

For in-demand rides with individual Lightning Lane options, booking starts at 7:00 AM for Disney hotel guests and at park opening for off-property guests.

Remember, you're guaranteed only 2-3 Lightning Lane selections per day, but with efficient planning, you can potentially enjoy more.
- For brand new attractions like Tiana's Bayou Adventure and popular rides such as Tron Lightcycle Run and Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind, expect to utilize the virtual queue system through the My Disney Experience app, or possibly purchase Individual Lightning Lane selections for direct access, though prices and availability may vary.
- Take advantage of Disney Genie+ and individual Lightning Lane selections to maximize your time at the parks.

- Consider visiting attractions with free virtual queue options like Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind or using the single rider line at Test Track to save on wait times without additional cost. Also, make use of free transportation like the Disney Skyliner to explore different parks and resorts.
- Skip unnecessary add-ons like Park Hoppers or Dining Plans if you're on a tight budget. Consider ordering groceries to your hotel room to save on meal costs.
